No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

I literally hated Slovak folklore, since it had always been supported by communists to the detriment of modern world culture, which was forbidden. I did not feel myself to be either Slovak or Czechoslovak. The only place I felt I belonged was Bratislava." In the days after the revolution there was talk that the capital of the federation should be in Brno, which is halfway between Prague and Bratislava. But there was a real sense that the Czechs did not understand Slovak sensitivities. The idea, Juraj said, that there was no time for such matters now, that the establishment of a market economy must come first, was quite shocking for him. He had been sure that Havel would understand the problem, that it could not continue under democracy as it had under communism. After the revolution Juraj became a member of the Co-ordinating Committee of the Revolution, a twelve member body. He spoke better English than the rest and worked on international relations.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.
Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist. There are differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks, he said. The Czechs are more eloquent, they have a stronger literary and artistic tradition, they are more secular, like Protestants, and they take ideology seriously. The Slovaks are more conservative, seventy per cent of them are Catholic, they are more down to earth and not so ready to be influenced by ideology.

For everything important you had to go to Prague; Slovakia was for lakes and rivers and mountains. Slovakia was a poor primitive country; the industry and the wealth were in the hands of the Czechs.

He accepted the post with the original intention that he would later become a vice-president - a step that Slovakia would have welcomed, but it never came about. The opposite happened, since Knazko often disagreed with Havel and his team and strongly fought for Slovak interests. After several weeks in the Castle he lost direct access to the President and sometimes found himself waiting for days before Havel would agree to meet him. There were ten million Czechs and five million Slovaks; the ruling class in Bratislava came to feel throughout 1990 that they were being treated as nice peasants who lived in the mountains, who did not know enough to be part of the great velvet future, whose education out of their fascism and their Catholicism would take a long time. Prague was not even aware that there was a festering Slovak problem, as there was no Slovak newspaper available in Prague and no Slovak politician close to Havel. Slovak emigrants in the United States pointed out that as far as the western media were concerned, Slovakia did not exist.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there. Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist. There are differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks, he said.
He noticed that former friends now in power were becoming increasingly pompous. In his book he wrote of a former colleague: When I visited him in Prague and tried to explain something which he wasn't prepared to accept as valid, he asked whether I realised I was talking to the Federal Minister of the Interior.

The Czechs are more eloquent, they have a stronger literary and artistic tradition, they are more secular, like Protestants, and they take ideology seriously.

He was also outraged by the way friends of his who had become Slovak politicians had been treated; one, he believed, had been accused of being a police informer under the old regime because he opposed Havel's policies on Slovakia. He noticed that former friends now in power were becoming increasingly pompous. In his book he wrote of a former colleague: When I visited him in Prague and tried to explain something which he wasn't prepared to accept as valid, he asked whether I realised I was talking to the Federal Minister of the Interior. Another example: a director who was spontaneously greeted on the street by her friend's son lectured the boy "the times have changed and you cannot address me as Susanne anymore."

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

There are differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks, he said. The Czechs are more eloquent, they have a stronger literary and artistic tradition, they are more secular, like Protestants, and they take ideology seriously.

From 1987 he was unemployed again and the following years he started secretly to edit and distribute Christian Democratic propaganda. The second half of the 198os, he said, saw the rise of the organised Catholic movement in Slovakia. There were pilgrimages to holy shrines. In 1987, for example, he told me, about six hundred thousand people took part in pilgrimages in Slovakia, and through this a self-conscious Catholic movement took shape. The state allowed and, in certain respects, encouraged an official church, but this was organised by a secret church, and it was the secret church which planned that first demonstration in March 1988, a secret church made up of priests and lay activists.

I felt that Juraj was excited being here and was looking forward to what the politician, who was called Jan Carnogursky, was going to say to a foreign journalist. Carnogursky was in his fifties. He was a thin man with a cautious and serious appearance. His parents were both teachers, he said, but his father had been a political activist before the war and had supported the Slovak state during the war. After the war he had tried to establish a Catholic party, and was imprisoned.

In the spring of 1990 discussion began over the name of the federation and whether there should be a dash between Czech and Slovak. Various Czech politicians openly made fun of the Slovaks and said that the dash could be used in Bratislava but not abroad.

He accepted the post with the original intention that he would later become a vice-president - a step that Slovakia would have welcomed, but it never came about. The opposite happened, since Knazko often disagreed with Havel and his team and strongly fought for Slovak interests. After several weeks in the Castle he lost direct access to the President and sometimes found himself waiting for days before Havel would agree to meet him.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there. Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist. There are differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks, he said.

He himself wanted the relationship between the two states to be modelled on states of the European Union. I asked him about the war years. During the war, he said, Slovakia was formally independent for the first time. The Slovak state was quite successful, he said, economically, culturally, politically. Its president was a Catholic priest, Dr Josef Tiso, and there is, he said, a positive feeling among Catholics about this state.

Juraj had a fancy car outside the apartment building, and I could see, as we sat in it to drive to his studio, that he enjoyed having a car like this. He put a tape on as he drove up through the city and then along narrow twisting roads, climbing all the time. The studio was a house in its own grounds at the end of a lane.

Juraj and Tana had talked as though all this had just happened to them, they had spoken with that peculiar intensity of people after an accident or a bereavement. I tried to think about it, work it all out, but when I saw them again at noon the next day, I felt as though I had not left their company at all. Juraj had a fancy car outside the apartment building, and I could see, as we sat in it to drive to his studio, that he enjoyed having a car like this. He put a tape on as he drove up through the city and then along narrow twisting roads, climbing all the time. The studio was a house in its own grounds at the end of a lane.

In the spring of 1990 discussion began over the name of the federation and whether there should be a dash between Czech and Slovak.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there. Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist. There are differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks, he said. The Czechs are more eloquent, they have a stronger literary and artistic tradition, they are more secular, like Protestants, and they take ideology seriously. The Slovaks are more conservative, seventy per cent of them are Catholic, they are more down to earth and not so ready to be influenced by ideology. The way the Czechs have been treating us, he said, seems OK only because we are Catholics, but if we were Muslims it would be quite different, there would be war.

There were ten million Czechs and five million Slovaks; the ruling class in Bratislava came to feel throughout 1990 that they were being treated as nice peasants who lived in the mountains, who did not know enough to be part of the great velvet future, whose education out of their fascism and their Catholicism would take a long time. Prague was not even aware that there was a festering Slovak problem, as there was no Slovak newspaper available in Prague and no Slovak politician close to Havel.
Originally, there were to be eight Slovaks, but the new government rang from Prague and reduced the number to four, and then put it back to eight when there were protests. This was followed by a trip to Israel. No Slovak politician was included; the two Slovaks in the delegation were representatives of the Jewish community. For Juraj, it was vital that a Slovak politician be present to apologise for what happened to the Jews in Slovakia during the war, and to make clear that the new Slovakia harboured no anti-Semitic feelings. In the end the actor Milan Knazko, a close friend of Juraj's and a leader of the revolution in Bratislava, went and made a speech. Milan Knazko's story,' Juraj wrote in his book, 'as Havel's Slovak adviser at the Prague Castle speaks for itself. He accepted the post with the original intention that he would later become a vice-president - a step that Slovakia would have welcomed, but it never came about.

He was not a Slovak nationalist; for him anti-communism was more important. Nationalism, he said, is always quite easy to misuse, as a means of mobilising people. A good number of former communists, he told me, quickly became nationalists. He himself wanted the relationship between the two states to be modelled on states of the European Union. I asked him about the war years. During the war, he said, Slovakia was formally independent for the first time.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.

At the beginning, Juraj said, Vaclav Havel was loved by everybody, and the problems between the two parts of Czechoslovakia did not surface. As he wrote: 'Before 1989I did not have any strong feelings of nationality. I literally hated Slovak folklore, since it had always been supported by communists to the detriment of modern world culture, which was forbidden. I did not feel myself to be either Slovak or Czechoslovak. The only place I felt I belonged was Bratislava." In the days after the revolution there was talk that the capital of the federation should be in Brno, which is halfway between Prague and Bratislava. But there was a real sense that the Czechs did not understand Slovak sensitivities.
The police surrounded the square, they had water cannon and police dogs, but nothing happened.

In the days after the revolution there was talk that the capital of the federation should be in Brno, which is halfway between Prague and Bratislava. But there was a real sense that the Czechs did not understand Slovak sensitivities. The idea, Juraj said, that there was no time for such matters now, that the establishment of a market economy must come first, was quite shocking for him.

In 1983 Juraj was permitted to make and sell flower-pots; in the looser atmosphere of the Gorbachev years he began to export ceramics to Austria, and this business grew throughout the 198os.

They are more cerebral, he said, more interested in money; we are more emotional. The two nations did not have to separate; but, at the time, there was no better solution.

There were ten million Czechs and five million Slovaks; the ruling class in Bratislava came to feel throughout 1990 that they were being treated as nice peasants who lived in the mountains, who did not know enough to be part of the great velvet future, whose education out of their fascism and their Catholicism would take a long time.

He noticed that former friends now in power were becoming increasingly pompous.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.
