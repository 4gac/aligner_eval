Simpson’s lawyers are not praised as adept defense attorneys, but disparaged as unscrupulous flouters of the rules who played the race card” in a case that should have been about science—no matter how poorly that science was deployed. Resentment continues to fester that Simpson was afforded the best defense money could buy, in the form of Cochran. It offended me, ” Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor, says to Edelman, because he was using a very serious, for-real issue—racial injustice—in defense of a man who wanted nothing to do with the black community. ” It offended me, too.

The evidence all looked so obvious to a lay observer: the vivid record of spousal abuse (He’s going to kill me, ” Nicole Brown Simpson yelled to an officer who responded to one of her many calls); the bloody shoe print, which matched shoes Simpson owned; the bloody glove found at the murder scene, which matched the glove at Simpson’s home; the blood on Simpson’s car and his socks and in his bathroom.

But I never forgot it. ” Simpson, who had turned his back on race men while making millions selling himself as inoffensive to middle-class white people, didn’t hesitate to empower one of them now that his life was on the line. Thus the Simpson defense team presented an ironic alchemy—an activist tradition that Simpson had rejected, fueled by funds that he’d garnered rejecting it.

For an outsider, such improvised music often sounds strange, cacophonous. Patients too usually need some time to adjust themselves to and feel comfortable with the improvisation set-up. Improvisation is often used as a psychotherapeutic approach when words fail and emotions are hard to express.

A Houdini performance was their life in miniature, with one heroic difference—he escaped. LONG BEFORE HE LED THE POLICE on a chase through L. A. , Simpson had been an escape artist. His rare athletic talent freed him from an impoverished childhood, and brought him to USC on a football scholarship in 1967. Made in America, deftly capturing his athleticism, is alert to symbolism too, replaying Simpson’s manifold escapes while at USC and later with the Buffalo Bills.

Composition Composition is used in music therapy to express feelings, to experiment with music but also to counteract the ephemerality of music by creating a mental and emotional anchor. In the pediatric setting, for example, children may rewrite the words to their favorite songs in order to understand or express their fears and to gain courage in facing them. During terminal care, composition provides a space to explore fundamental questions about life, dying and death.
Improvisation implies the extempore – something out of time and unprepared – i. e. engaging with the unpredictable, as all of us are challenged to do in our everyday lives when we must draw spontaneously on our own resources, make on-the-spot decisions, or react to situations in unexpected ways. One of the aims when the therapist and patient review what has taken place during an improvisation session is to identify those aspects of the music making that the patient him- or herself experiences as particularly useful. For an outsider, such improvised music often sounds strange, cacophonous. Patients too usually need some time to adjust themselves to and feel comfortable with the improvisation set-up.

Receptive music therapy can also be applied at the bedside. Especially in situations – such as the approach of death – when anxieties may be strong, music can bring about both physical and psychic relaxation (anxiolysis) and may reduce pain (audioanalgesia).

It marked Simpson’s individual success at hurdling that wall. Landing on the other side, Simpson, a product of public housing in inner-city San Francisco, found reinvention as a celebrity.

Palliative/Relaxational The goal of relaxational music therapy is to procure psychophysical relaxation through listening to music. In the Clinic for Tumor Biology in Freiburg, for such therapy we employ the monochord, a 30- stringed instrument, played live by the therapist. In group work we refer to this approach as sound meditation. It enables many patients who encounter problems with other relaxation modalities to achieve an intense experience of deep relaxation and inner peace. Receptive music therapy can also be applied at the bedside. Especially in situations – such as the approach of death – when anxieties may be strong, music can bring about both physical and psychic relaxation (anxiolysis) and may reduce pain (audioanalgesia). When other senses are closed off (sight for example) or numbed by medication, through the ear, music can often still reach the body and ‘soul’ of the sick person. Rehabilitative Here music is used to support processes of self-discovery and psychotherapy.

Usually classical music is employed as a sound setting to bring forth inner images, ideas and memories that are subsequently discussed, assimilated and therapeutically integrated by the patient. Functional Applied appropriately, listening to stimulating music, a simple rhythm or even just a regular beat can have therapeutic benefits. During physiotherapy following a stroke, for example, listening to a metric beat can facilitate the relearning of certain gait functions such as walking speed and step length [11]. Thaut and his colleagues [12] have also been able to show that an acoustic-rhythmic stimulus can improve the movement and speech motor control of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

Composition Composition is used in music therapy to express feelings, to experiment with music but also to counteract the ephemerality of music by creating a mental and emotional anchor. In the pediatric setting, for example, children may rewrite the words to their favorite songs in order to understand or express their fears and to gain courage in facing them. During terminal care, composition provides a space to explore fundamental questions about life, dying and death. Such patients may write pieces as a legacy for the most important people in their lives, expressing their love, gratitude and appreciation. In work with adults, writing the melodies and texts of songs can help to thematize painful experiences and address traumas. During the composition process, discussion with the therapist helps the patient to assimilate the topics that are relevant to the therapy and then feed these reflections back into the creative artistic practice.

Simpson’s legal team worked those preconceptions the way a boxer might work an opponent’s wound, relentlessly attacking the numerous flaws in an investigation and an evidence-collection process that were egregiously careless: the blanket thrown over Nicole Brown Simpson’s body, exposing it to fibers and the DNA of others in the house; the sensitive material collected bare-handed; the sample of Simpson’s blood stored in an envelope in an officer’s care and brought to Simpson’s house.

Usually classical music is employed as a sound setting to bring forth inner images, ideas and memories that are subsequently discussed, assimilated and therapeutically integrated by the patient. Functional Applied appropriately, listening to stimulating music, a simple rhythm or even just a regular beat can have therapeutic benefits. During physiotherapy following a stroke, for example, listening to a metric beat can facilitate the relearning of certain gait functions such as walking speed and step length [11]. Thaut and his colleagues [12] have also been able to show that an acoustic-rhythmic stimulus can improve the movement and speech motor control of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

Today, even in fields of medicine strongly dominated by evidence-based approaches, music, with or without a therapist, has become a scientifically proven ‘remedy’ that offers patients a nondrug, complementary medical treatment.

He was identifiably black, but measured against the brashness of Muhammad Ali and the coiled rage of Jim Brown, his distinction was to radiate reassurance and respectability. In the successful series of ads he starred in for Hertz beginning in 1975, he was still running—only now through airports, an icon of social mobility, with white people cheering him on: Go, O. J. ” An old friend of Simpson’s says in Made in America that Simpson was seduced by white society. ” Perhaps. But the seduction was mutual, and he used his football fame to gain access to white patrons eager to expose him to the finer things in life. I took him places where I think very few black men had ever been, ” Frank Olson, the former CEO of Hertz, says in the film. Simpson mingled with wealthy entrepreneurs at golf clubs where he was one of the few black members, or the first and only black member.

After his retirement in 1979, he began doing some acting and dreamed of playing Coalhouse Walker in the film adaptation of the book. Simpson felt the role of Walker, a black ragtime piano player turned revolutionary, matched his life.
Since Simpson’s practices show he clearly has no interest in the affairs of black people, ” I wrote, the question becomes why do blacks have any interest in him? ” In those days, I conceived of African Americans as a kind of political party, which needed only, in unison, to select the correct strategy in order to make the scourge of racism disappear.

But Simpson does resemble another character in the book, one whose feats explain the strange bond between Simpson and the black community.

So why was it that the latter seemed to be all that mattered, and what did it have to do with Simpson, who lived a life far beyond the embattled ghettos of L. A. ? I vented in the school newspaper. Since Simpson’s practices show he clearly has no interest in the affairs of black people, ” I wrote, the question becomes why do blacks have any interest in him? ” In those days, I conceived of African Americans as a kind of political party, which needed only, in unison, to select the correct strategy in order to make the scourge of racism disappear. Expending political capital on O. J. Simpson struck me as exactly the opposite of the correct strategy.

To make sure the doubt was harvested, Simpson leaned on the kind of activist he’d long spurned. These days Johnnie Cochran is remembered almost in caricature, mocked on Seinfeld and derided as a race hustler.
The evidence all looked so obvious to a lay observer: the vivid record of spousal abuse (He’s going to kill me, ” Nicole Brown Simpson yelled to an officer who responded to one of her many calls); the bloody shoe print, which matched shoes Simpson owned; the bloody glove found at the murder scene, which matched the glove at Simpson’s home; the blood on Simpson’s car and his socks and in his bathroom. For Johnnie Cochran, Simpson’s lead lawyer, rage against police brutality had personal roots. About his experience of being pulled over by LAPD officers who then drew their guns, he said, I never made an issue of it.

(Vince Bucci / Getty) Simpson was a running back, a position dominated by African Americans for the past half century—a fact that has often been invoked to boost racist thinking about the innate athleticism of blacks. More pertinent, the job of the running back—to escape—is the most basic of vocations, one that a kid from the projects can begin practicing in that first game of tag. Running also holds a special significance to a people denied violent resistance as a viable option, if only because it has always been the most potent tool available. The runaway slave is a fixture in the American imagination. As the writer Isabel Wilkerson notes in her account of the Great Migration, the blacks who fled the South during the 20th century did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have often done. They left. ” There is also a less reputable history of fleeing among African Americans—the tradition of those blacks light enough to pass” as white and disappear into the overclass. Simpson’s great fortune was to reach the height of his powers in the 1970s, after the civil- rights movement, a time when one might enact the rituals of passing not by looking white, but by possessing qualities that white society envied. Simpson was a celebrity.

Palliative/Relaxational The goal of relaxational music therapy is to procure psychophysical relaxation through listening to music. In the Clinic for Tumor Biology in Freiburg, for such therapy we employ the monochord, a 30- stringed instrument, played live by the therapist. In group work we refer to this approach as sound meditation. It enables many patients who encounter problems with other relaxation modalities to achieve an intense experience of deep relaxation and inner peace. Receptive music therapy can also be applied at the bedside.

Music therapy is now rapidly shedding its exotic status and developing into a serious, scientifically based discipline with a broad range of therapeutic options. One of the most important prerequisites for an effective therapy is that the patient enjoys what he or she is doing and hearing. Under these conditions, music can unfold its healing powers. What O.

Simpson’s arrest for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman was atypical. It was 1994. I was a young black man attending a historically black university in the majority-black city of Washington, D. C. , with zero sympathy for Simpson, zero understanding of the sympathy he elicited from my people, and zero appreciation for the defense team’s claim that Simpson had been targeted because he was black.
Two things, it seemed to me, could be true at once: Simpson was a serial abuser who killed his ex-wife, and the Los Angeles Police Department was a brutal army of occupation.

What I couldn’t fathom in 1994 was a reality that black people around me likely sensed and that Made in America brings into deeply discomfiting focus: that Simpson may well have murdered his ex-wife and her friend, and that the jury got it right in declaring him not guilty.

Usually classical music is employed as a sound setting to bring forth inner images, ideas and memories that are subsequently discussed, assimilated and therapeutically integrated by the patient. Functional Applied appropriately, listening to stimulating music, a simple rhythm or even just a regular beat can have therapeutic benefits.

Today, even in fields of medicine strongly dominated by evidence-based approaches, music, with or without a therapist, has become a scientifically proven ‘remedy’ that offers patients a nondrug, complementary medical treatment.

When other senses are closed off (sight for example) or numbed by medication, through the ear, music can often still reach the body and ‘soul’ of the sick person. Rehabilitative Here music is used to support processes of self-discovery and psychotherapy. One established method is guided imagery and music. Usually classical music is employed as a sound setting to bring forth inner images, ideas and memories that are subsequently discussed, assimilated and therapeutically integrated by the patient. Functional Applied appropriately, listening to stimulating music, a simple rhythm or even just a regular beat can have therapeutic benefits. During physiotherapy following a stroke, for example, listening to a metric beat can facilitate the relearning of certain gait functions such as walking speed and step length [11].

Today, even in fields of medicine strongly dominated by evidence-based approaches, music, with or without a therapist, has become a scientifically proven ‘remedy’ that offers patients a nondrug, complementary medical treatment.

When the LAPD collared O. J. Simpson, the police force had gotten its man.
When the LAPD collared O. J. Simpson, the police force had gotten its man. The evidence all looked so obvious to a lay observer: the vivid record of spousal abuse (He’s going to kill me, ” Nicole Brown Simpson yelled to an officer who responded to one of her many calls); the bloody shoe print, which matched shoes Simpson owned; the bloody glove found at the murder scene, which matched the glove at Simpson’s home; the blood on Simpson’s car and his socks and in his bathroom.
