The fact that, back in the field, I had been able to pick him out from the scuffed pack of others doesn’t seem quite right, somehow. He should have been just another stranger who happened across my path, but he wasn’t.

That picture was crooked when I first entered this house, the better part of ten years ago now, to ask Elizabeth if she might like to come out for a walk along the shore with me. And it was crooked, too, on the day I left, the day I turned my back on all the sorrows and the joys and walked out, with England in my sights but America very much on my mind. Elizabeth was already gone by then, in the toughest way imaginable, her grave on the stony hillside marked by a name half-mine chiselled into rock and buried to a great depth. Yet everywhere I turned I could see her, every voice I heard shifted with her own musical timbre. America lay a full huge ocean away, and I wanted to believe that would be more than far enough for escape. But it was not. Home can be like a disease.

Neither of us wants an argument, so we tread lightly, but the words prove difficult to come by and when spoken don’t seem nearly enough to cover all that needs saying.

Christ. Standing here now, it feels impossible that so much time has passed. Time should change things, really change them, not merely tug at the seams. Since the day I left I have held a picture of this place in my mind, a matted image that hardly deviates from any of the hundred such scenic postcards that they peddle to the tourists in every seaside town and village up and down the country.

Standing here now, it feels impossible that so much time has passed. Time should change things, really change them, not merely tug at the seams. Since the day I left I have held a picture of this place in my mind, a matted image that hardly deviates from any of the hundred such scenic postcards that they peddle to the tourists in every seaside town and village up and down the country.

Since the day I left I have held a picture of this place in my mind, a matted image that hardly deviates from any of the hundred such scenic postcards that they peddle to the tourists in every seaside town and village up and down the country. A small farmhouse cottage set back from the twist of dirt road, its thatched roof touched up with season after season of newly cut reeds and always keeping to just the right side of a sunken abyss.

And five or so acres back beyond the cottage, the land finally rolls away, collapsing down into the jagged spokes of shale that rake the sea.

The only difference in six years is the fresh coat of whitewash. Six years. Christ. Standing here now, it feels impossible that so much time has passed.

The night passes in snatches, the essences of sleep and wakefulness so diluting one another that in short order they become two sides of the same tarnished and constantly spinning coin. After the sickly gloaming of those half-nights in the cities, this darkness feels absolute. Riptides of memory claw at my mind, and I toss and turn in the old bed and try to ignore the ghosts that whisper reminders of late-hour embraces and last broken breaths. The dreams, when they come, are time trips that deepen and dissolve, and then I am back again into the waking pit, gasping at the turgid air.
He looks at me again, for longer than is comfortable, even with the dusk thickening walls between us. I get the sense that he is studying me too, matching details as I had done.

A little after five, I hear movement, the croak of a floorboard, outside my bedroom door.
He looks up when I come to the back door but his eyes have the watery resonance of a dream and it takes him a moment to register my presence as something real.
He looks up when I come to the back door but his eyes have the watery resonance of a dream and it takes him a moment to register my presence as something real. Then he rises slowly but not quite fully, courtesy of the hard-won lumbar kink that keeps him off-balance and constantly at odds, and by way of greeting he offers a hand that is nothing but rags and sticks.

The old transistor radio in the corner is skipping out a fiddled reel that seems without beginning or end but the station is slipping in and out of tune in a way that brings a wonderful and priceless sense of distortion to the piece.

He scrapes what little waste there is, the bacon rinds and a few crusts of bread, into a small bin, and lowers the plates into a large yellow plastic basin so that they can soak for a couple of hours.

And now, this close and with nothing to distract, I can’t help noticing that the way he squares his jaw was the way Elizabeth squared hers whenever she was trying to be strong in the face of something troubling. Or that he has her eyes, her shade of green that is nearly grey, a peculiarly coastal shade of eye, mirroring the sea but only at a certain dying moment of the day, when the light has been mostly sucked out of the sky and the surface turns reflective, hiding its greater depths. I see the details of Elizabeth in him, and if I just consider the nose or the little crooked corner of that mouth, I will see details of myself there, too. But I know when to look away. It is the pretence that keeps this house of cards upright, and denial becomes easier with practice. Anyone who has ever run more than two steps worth of escape understands that.

His control is not perfect but his put-on swagger of confidence more than makes up for that fact, and when the ball slips loose of its invisible leash he shapes his face so as to pass the mistake off as intentional.

He’s good as gold.” Tommy licks his mouth, bunches his chin in a way that squeezes up his face, the pasty flesh rippling and then holding its folds.
He’s good as gold.” Tommy licks his mouth, bunches his chin in a way that squeezes up his face, the pasty flesh rippling and then holding its folds. He is thinking of something that won’t be shared, and a softness turns his mouth and sets his eyes to glistening.

And now, this close and with nothing to distract, I can’t help noticing that the way he squares his jaw was the way Elizabeth squared hers whenever she was trying to be strong in the face of something troubling.
I did. A week back.
I did. A week back. I’d just about given up expecting you.”
I did. A week back. I’d just about given up expecting you.” It’s been a while, all right.

I get the sense that he is studying me too, matching details as I had done.

They know who belongs here on this island and they know how to recognise tourists. Fitting neither category quite right, I have triggered confusion. The only difference in six years is the fresh coat of whitewash. Six years. Christ. Standing here now, it feels impossible that so much time has passed.

I have a question that I want to ask, whether or not Tommy has any idea why Elizabeth did what she did, but that question is always in my mind, always, and I know better than to cut it loose. Instead I ask him to tell me how Jack is doing at school, and how he is in general, and I lean forward with my elbows on the table and make sure to absorb every word of reply.
It shifts a little but not far. Sun’s coming up,” I say, in a thoughtful tone that doesn’t encourage an answer, but it’s my excuse to step outside, to gaze westward at the sloe-coloured ocean lying pinned beneath the last of night and to feel another dawn peeling open at my shoulder.

It’s been probably three or four days since he last bothered to shave, and the blue- white dusting of stubble gives him a look of wild horses and wind-battered sails. Tourists would pay hard-won cash for a picture of a face so full of character. He smiles at somethingand I know that a memory has broken slowly across his bow. I wait for him to share the thought, but he doesn’t, and it’s not my place to push. Minutes pass.
It’s like I said in the letter.
It’s like I said in the letter. I just had an urge to come home.

I’ll tell you, Bill. If it wasn’t for the boy, I don’t know how I’d have coped. Big subjects lie between us like shards of glass. Neither of us wants an argument, so we tread lightly, but the words prove difficult to come by and when spoken don’t seem nearly enough to cover all that needs saying.

I’ll write, I say, the best that I can manage, and I slip my hands into my pockets and stroll away, counting the steps so that I won’t look back.

I’m responsible for that chip on his shoulder.
I’m responsible for that chip on his shoulder. The night passes in snatches, the essences of sleep and wakefulness so diluting one another that in short order they become two sides of the same tarnished and constantly spinning coin.
I’m responsible for that chip on his shoulder.

The night passes in snatches, the essences of sleep and wakefulness so diluting one another that in short order they become two sides of the same tarnished and constantly spinning coin. After the sickly gloaming of those half-nights in the cities, this darkness feels absolute. Riptides of memory claw at my mind, and I toss and turn in the old bed and try to ignore the ghosts that whisper reminders of late-hour embraces and last broken breaths. The dreams, when they come, are time trips that deepen and dissolve, and then I am back again into the waking pit, gasping at the turgid air.

I’m starving,” he says, at last, and twisting away into the shadows he finds a large knife in the cutlery drawer and proceeds to cut himself a doorstop slice of soda bread.

Jack? He’s grand. He’s good as gold.” Tommy licks his mouth, bunches his chin in a way that squeezes up his face, the pasty flesh rippling and then holding its folds.
Jack? He’s grand. He’s good as gold.” Tommy licks his mouth, bunches his chin in a way that squeezes up his face, the pasty flesh rippling and then holding its folds. He is thinking of something that won’t be shared, and a softness turns his mouth and sets his eyes to glistening.

Made a story out of it and filled in a few of the blanks, softened it up. Going on about a mother’s love, and how there are all kinds of sicknesses. For now, that’s enough. If he ever asks for more, I suppose I’ll tell him, but I doubt it will ever come to that. We sit until the silence becomes too much, and we are stuck in the same direction. Then Tommy stands with a groan and gathers the plates, leaving the cups. It is early, and we’ll drink a lot more tea yet before the time comes for me to catch the ferry. He scrapes what little waste there is, the bacon rinds and a few crusts of bread, into a small bin, and lowers the plates into a large yellow plastic basin so that they can soak for a couple of hours. Watching his back, I lift an envelope from inside my shirt. Whenever I had money, they had money too; when I was on my heels they got by without.

It is the pretence that keeps this house of cards upright, and denial becomes easier with practice. Anyone who has ever run more than two steps worth of escape understands that.

And five or so acres back beyond the cottage, the land finally rolls away, collapsing down into the jagged spokes of shale that rake the sea. A huge cloak of sky completes the picture, a sky always working, from minute to minute moiling to churn out yet more new tricks of the light, now the glare of a tilted looking- glass, now the deception of smoke. The ocean today is calm, another April lie in a place that has practiced such skill to perfection. Tommy is in the kitchen, sitting hunched over in a hard chair with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands laced together in a prayerful grip.

A small farmhouse cottage set back from the twist of dirt road, its thatched roof touched up with season after season of newly cut reeds and always keeping to just the right side of a sunken abyss. And five or so acres back beyond the cottage, the land finally rolls away, collapsing down into the jagged spokes of shale that rake the sea. A huge cloak of sky completes the picture, a sky always working, from minute to minute moiling to churn out yet more new tricks of the light, now the glare of a tilted looking- glass, now the deception of smoke.

Then he rises slowly but not quite fully, courtesy of the hard-won lumbar kink that keeps him off-balance and constantly at odds, and by way of greeting he offers a hand that is nothing but rags and sticks.
Sun’s coming up,” I say, in a thoughtful tone that doesn’t encourage an answer, but it’s my excuse to step outside, to gaze westward at the sloe-coloured ocean lying pinned beneath the last of night and to feel another dawn peeling open at my shoulder.

Elizabeth was already gone by then, in the toughest way imaginable, her grave on the stony hillside marked by a name half-mine chiselled into rock and buried to a great depth.

The boy enters the house at a run, draws up with an audible gasp when he sees me.
The boy enters the house at a run, draws up with an audible gasp when he sees me. By now, the kitchen is swamped in twilight, and I recall such moments as these from the springtime days of my own childhood, the few minutes when night feels close but not yet quite here and it is still too soon to think of sparking awake the lantern.

Or that he has her eyes, her shade of green that is nearly grey, a peculiarly coastal shade of eye, mirroring the sea but only at a certain dying moment of the day, when the light has been mostly sucked out of the sky and the surface turns reflective, hiding its greater depths. I see the details of Elizabeth in him, and if I just consider the nose or the little crooked corner of that mouth, I will see details of myself there, too. But I know when to look away. It is the pretence that keeps this house of cards upright, and denial becomes easier with practice.
The fact that, back in the field, I had been able to pick him out from the scuffed pack of others doesn’t seem quite right, somehow.

The ocean today is calm, another April lie in a place that has practiced such skill to perfection. Tommy is in the kitchen, sitting hunched over in a hard chair with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands laced together in a prayerful grip. He looks up when I come to the back door but his eyes have the watery resonance of a dream and it takes him a moment to register my presence as something real. Then he rises slowly but not quite fully, courtesy of the hard-won lumbar kink that keeps him off-balance and constantly at odds, and by way of greeting he offers a hand that is nothing but rags and sticks.

The old ghosts are waiting. I shake Jack’s hand, because a hug would be too awkward, even though it is probably something we both want.

Since the day I left I have held a picture of this place in my mind, a matted image that hardly deviates from any of the hundred such scenic postcards that they peddle to the tourists in every seaside town and village up and down the country.

Tourists would pay hard-won cash for a picture of a face so full of character. He smiles at somethingand I know that a memory has broken slowly across his bow.

There is no more, really, to be said.
There is no more, really, to be said. I have a question that I want to ask, whether or not Tommy has any idea why Elizabeth did what she did, but that question is always in my mind, always, and I know better than to cut it loose.

And five or so acres back beyond the cottage, the land finally rolls away, collapsing down into the jagged spokes of shale that rake the sea. A huge cloak of sky completes the picture, a sky always working, from minute to minute moiling to churn out yet more new tricks of the light, now the glare of a tilted looking- glass, now the deception of smoke. The ocean today is calm, another April lie in a place that has practiced such skill to perfection. Tommy is in the kitchen, sitting hunched over in a hard chair with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands laced together in a prayerful grip. He looks up when I come to the back door but his eyes have the watery resonance of a dream and it takes him a moment to register my presence as something real.
Time should change things, really change them, not merely tug at the seams.

Tommy boils a kettle of water for tea, lays a few strips of bacon in a pan.
Tommy boils a kettle of water for tea, lays a few strips of bacon in a pan. I sit there and watch his shuffled moves as he tends to his business, and decide that this sort of hour does no one any favours.

The old transistor radio in the corner is skipping out a fiddled reel that seems without beginning or end but the station is slipping in and out of tune in a way that brings a wonderful and priceless sense of distortion to the piece.

By now, the kitchen is swamped in twilight, and I recall such moments as these from the springtime days of my own childhood, the few minutes when night feels close but not yet quite here and it is still too soon to think of sparking awake the lantern.

It is early, and we’ll drink a lot more tea yet before the time comes for me to catch the ferry. He scrapes what little waste there is, the bacon rinds and a few crusts of bread, into a small bin, and lowers the plates into a large yellow plastic basin so that they can soak for a couple of hours.

I clear my throat but my voice, when it comes, feels as if it belongs to someone else. How is he?” Jack? He’s grand. He’s good as gold.” Tommy licks his mouth, bunches his chin in a way that squeezes up his face, the pasty flesh rippling and then holding its folds. He is thinking of something that won’t be shared, and a softness turns his mouth and sets his eyes to glistening.
You know my granddad?”
You know my granddad?” I ought to, since I’m sitting here drinking his whiskey.

You lost, mister? he asks, after a minute or so has passed.
You lost, mister? he asks, after a minute or so has passed. It is only the middle of the day and there is no need to hurry.
You lost, mister? he asks, after a minute or so has passed. It is only the middle of the day and there is no need to hurry. The others mutter their amusement at his question and I, for my part, feel obliged to break open a smile, but suddenly I have a lump in my throat that makes it difficult to swallow.
