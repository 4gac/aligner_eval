there is however a lack of (other) in these authors (other) as to the specific (other) of handedness related differences (empty)
such differences have been found either in the localization the volumes or the number of activated areas in the two hemispheres or in the specific presence of ipsilateral activation in the motor control of the preferred vs non preferred hand (empty)
moreover this ipsilateral activation pattern seems to be dependent on such features as movement complexity (empty)
in their fmri study solodkin and coauthors 2001 found that during the performance of a sequential finger movement task left handers (other) to (other) larger volumes in a greater number of association (other) and showed less lateralization than did righthanders (empty)
a (other) report by the same authors revealed that right handers had greater activation in the left premotor area for either hand indicating a general dominance of the left hemisphere in motor function whereas the left handed group showed a predominance of activation in the premotor cortex contralateral to the moving hand either left or right indicating no such asymmetry (other) et al 2002 (empty)
however similar (other) performed by volkman and colleagues 1998 in a (other) study and by (other) and others 1997 in an fmri study revealed that in both right and left handers the use of the preferred hand was associated with a greater volume of activation in the contralateral motor cortex (empty)

this study (other) the volume of left and right hemisphere activations during hand movements in right handers left handers and originally left handed individuals who during their (other) (other) pressure to switch hand preference toward the right side (empty)
our goal was to (other) issues related to the brain mechanisms of hand preference and specifically to investigate the effect of switching hand preferences on the organization of motor control in the brain (empty)
regarding the main question of the effect of hand preference on hemispheric asymmetry our study revealed that both in left handers and right handers movements of the preferred hand right in rh and left in lh (other) larger contralateral activations than movements of the non preferred hand (empty)
in contrast to this movement of the non preferred hand (other) to larger ipsilateral activations (empty)
consequently in right handers there was a general predominance of left hemisphere activation whereas in left handers there was a predominance of right hemisphere activation although in the latter case the asymmetry was (other) (empty)
(other) these effects were specific to complex rather than simple tasks during simple tasks the activations elicited by either hand were similar (empty)
this concords with the previous (other) by solodkin and coauthors 2001 and verstynen and others 2005 who also found handedness related differences (other) complex tasks (empty)
finding by klöppel and colleagues 2007 that the cortical sensorimotor representation may (other) on hand preference in simple bar pressing movements could be associated with the (other) procedure which (other) considerably from that (other) other studies (empty)
in this choice (other) time paradigm the subjects were expected to react with their left right or both hands depending on a (other) of one of three possible (other) cues (empty)
this task might present special difficulty for the left handers due to their problems with (other) between the left and right (other) (empty)
it seems plausible therefore that the results obtained by klöppel and coauthors 2007 are related to (other) regarding the hand choice rather than to (other) the execution of an (other) performed bar pressing (empty)
the finding that in both the rh and lh groups movements of the preferred hand lead to greater contralateral activation and movements of the non preferred hand lead to greater ipsilateral activation (other) the (other) of a common mechanism for motor control (empty)
it may (other) in (other) the motor control by the dominant hemisphere not only over the contralateral preferred hand but also over the ipsilateral nonpreferred hand (empty)
in contrast the non dominant hemisphere is involved mainly in the motor control of the contralateral non preferred hand (empty)
this conclusion also (other) the anatomical data showing structural asymmetries in the central (other) larger (other) of (other) motor cortex in the dominant hemisphere in right handers and left handers (empty)
interestingly (other) clinical study on right handed patients with unilateral (other) stroke (other) et al (other) provided further observation which (other) (other) our findings (empty)
in this study the authors assessed the relative use of the right left and both (other) with (other) (other) (empty)
the study demonstrated that the use of the ipsilateral but not contralateral limb after unilateral stroke was (other) by hand preference the right hemisphere damaged patients used their ipsilateral right preferred limb more than the left hemisphere damaged patients used their ipsilateral left non preferred limb and more than (other) righthanders (empty)
in other words the damage to the left hemisphere impaired the motor abilities of the left hand more than the damage to the right hemisphere impaired the motor abilities of the right hand (empty)
this might suggest that in right handers the involvement of the left dominant hemisphere in ipsilateral left hand motor control is greater than the involvement of the right hemisphere in the ipsilateral right hand motor control (empty)
this (other) concords our findings which showed the involvement of the left hemisphere in both the contralateral and ipsilateral motor control in right handers (empty)
those findings also (other) to our conclusion that the right hemisphere in right handers is mainly involved (other) contralateral left hand control and thus damage to this hemisphere does not have so much negative impact on the use of the right hand as does the damage to the left hemisphere on the use of the left hand (empty)
those data also (other) the general conclusion regarding the dominance of the left hemisphere in motor control in right handers (empty)
what could be the functional significance of relatively greater volume of activation in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred hand (empty)
it is (other) to (other) that an increase in the volume of neural (other) (other) in a motor behavior may support the (other) execution of that behavior (empty)
the (other) of hand motor cortex in the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant hand may thus provide the neural (other) for the more (other) execution of the complex motor activities performed by this hand (empty)
the high (other) in motor control of the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred hand may then be (other) during the execution of motor tasks not only by the preferred hand but also by the non preferred one (empty)
the finding of higher volumes of activation in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred hand in both right and left handers (other) with a few other functional imaging studies of right and left handers (empty)
in the present study we also investigated the brain organization patterns of subjects who were originally left handed but at the age of 7 were switched to (other) (empty)
the results showed that switched participants (other) features of both left handers and righthanders (empty)
therefore it could be (other) that the brains of the originally left handed subjects underwent plastic changes that (other) in reorganization of their motor function toward the right handed brain (empty)
this reorganization however was not complete and showed persisting features of the left handed brain (empty)
interestingly there was a (other) between the amount of (other) brain reorganization and the degree to which the individuals (other) their hand preferences toward the right side (empty)
although the differences in brain activation in the two switched su and ss groups were not (other) significant it is (other) (other) that the activation patterns of their brains reflected the differences (other) at the behavioral level the ss group was more similar to the rh group while the su group resembled the lh group at (other) when the pattern of ipsilateral activations was considered (empty)
consequently their hpis were significantly lower than those of the group of consistent right handers (empty)
this difference may reflect the importance of inherited factors in (other) brain architecture which can only undergo plastic changes to a (other) extent (empty)
similar conclusion was (other) by the authors of two previous studies performed on converted left handers using functional mri (empty)
the (other) of our study (other) in testing the effects of handedness on brain activation pattern using separate (other) for hand and hemisphere ipsilateral or contralateral to the moving hand (empty)
in (other) fmri studies the authors either used the paradigm which did not allow for (other) such (other) siebner et al 2002 or (other) (other) those factors klöppel et al 2007 (other) on (other) of brain regions (other) converted left handers showed a consistent difference in task related bold (other) across all movement conditions and hands (empty)
such (other) did not allow them to (other) on the mechanisms which as we have (other) may differ for ipsilateral vs contralateral activation patterns (empty)
the observation that in the two switched ss and su groups it was the patterns of ipsilateral and not contralateral activation which resembled that found in the rh and lh groups might suggest that the ipsilateral motor representation is more (other) to undergo reorganization due to educational training than the contralateral one (empty)
testing this interesting possibility however (other) more specific further (other) (empty)
it is (other) known that individual subjects whether they are right or left handed differ considerably as to their specific pattern of handedness (empty)
in this study we (other) to directly relate behavioral differences individual profiles of hand preference to individual patterns of activation in the two hemispheres (empty)
in other words the question was whether individual patterns of organization of motor control in the brain (other) a continuum that (other) directly with a continuum of individual patterns of hand preferences (empty)
our data revealed a significant correlation between total activation in the left hemisphere and the handedness preference index hpi that (other) that the stronger the right hand preference the larger the total volume of activation in the left hemisphere (empty)
a similar relationship between hand preference index and the anatomical parameters has been demonstrated by (other) and coauthors (other) (other) in the primary sensorimotor and by klöppel and others 2010 in the left (other) putamen (empty)

to (other) up in both left and right handed subjects the preferred hand is controlled mainly by the hemisphere contralateral to that hand whereas the nonpreferred hand is controlled by both hemispheres (empty)
the switched individuals share features of both left (other) right handers regarding their motor control architecture and hand preference profiles (empty)
increasing levels of complexity of motor activity results in an increase in the volume of consistently activated areas and the involvement of the ipsilateral in addition to contralateral activations especially in the dominant hemisphere (empty)
