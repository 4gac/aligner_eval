Another daughter was married to one of the two earls to whom the First Folio was dedicated. Oxford supporters find other evidence in the plays themselves. In Hamlet and King Lear, for example, they hear the voice of an aristocrat, not a commoner. The plays demonstrate a keen, intimate knowledge of how people in a royal court or a government bureaucracy think and operate,” says Whalen.

Any answer is going to be simply a human of a particular time and place. We regard Shakespeare today, she believes, the way his friend Ben Jonson did in his First Folio tribute – He was not of an age, but for all time! ”– and asks whether we really want to see him reduced to an ordinary mortal.

The sketchy paper trail from Shakespeare’s life hasn’t stopped the publishing industry from issuing a stream of biographies filled with phrases like may have” and could have”. Last year in the New York Times Book Review, editor Rachel Donadio mused whether Stephen Greenblatt’s 2005 biography of the Bard, Will in the World, should be on the fiction or the nonfiction bestseller list. There are documents from William Shakespeare’s life that concern his career as an actor and theater manager and so on, but there’s nothing that suggests a literary life,” says Mark Anderson, author of Shakespeare” by Another Name, an examination of the plays’ authorship. That’s what’s so damning about the documentary record.

Oxfordians, as they are known, dismiss Will of Stratford as a frontman for the ink-stained earl who used his name as a pseudonym. (More or less. Will’s surname was often Shakspere, but sometimes Shaxspere, Shagspere or Shaxberd, though variants on the spelling of names were hardly uncommon at the time.) Shakespeare the writer, whoever he was, was one of the most broadly educated authors in English literature,” says Anderson, an avowed Oxfordian.
Doubters over the years have proposed some 60 candidates as the real Shakespeare, among them Sir Walter Raleigh, Christopher Marlowe and Queen Elizabeth herself. The popular favorite among skeptics of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Francis Bacon, philosopher and writer. Some Baconians maintained that secret codes sprinkled throughout Shakespeare’s plays pointed to the works’ true author. (For example, by counting the difference in total words in two passages from Henry IV, Part 1, multiplying that by the number of hyphenations, then using the result to move up or maybe down a page somewhere else, you can begin to extract hidden messages in the plays, such as fetched – a long-dead member of Henry VIII’s court; a cabal of Jesuits – but the very proliferation of theories demonstrated how deeply unsatisfying many people found the Stratford story to be.

The poet-playwright was steeped in the classics and drew on source texts that hadn’t yet been translated into English.

We regard Shakespeare today, she believes, the way his friend Ben Jonson did in his First Folio tribute – He was not of an age, but for all time! ”– and asks whether we really want to see him reduced to an ordinary mortal.

In Droeshout’s anatomically awkward rendering, which he likely copied from a life portrait that no longer exists, the subject looks distant and slightly uncomfortable, as though he’d rather not be posing at all.

Last year, a scientific examination revealed that one of the most familiar likenesses of the playwright, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s so-called Flower portrait – once thought to have been done in the Bard’s lifetime and to have perhaps been the source of the Droeshout engraving – was actually concocted in the 19th century.

In fact, there’s no hard evidence that Will Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon (1564-1616), revered as the greatest author in the English language, could even write a complete sentence. Is it any wonder that controversy swirls around the authorship of the 154 sonnets and some 37 plays credited to him? Skeptics have long belittled the notion of a barely educated small-town boy who moves to London to work as an actor and is suddenly writing masterpieces of unrivaled beauty and sophistication. Henry James wrote to a friend in 1903 that he was haunted by the conviction that the divine William is the biggest and most successful fraud ever practised on a patient world.” Other doubters have included Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Sigmund Freud, Orson Welles and Sir John Gielgud.

If Shakespeare hadn’t been metamorphosed into a god, nobody would think it was worth having an authorship controversy about him,” says Jonathan Bate, a Shakespeare expert at the University of Warwick, not far from Stratford.

It’s certainly curious that the creator of such vivid, recognizably human characters as Falstaff, Lear and Hamlet should himself remain as insubstantial as stage smoke.

In looking for a portrait of Shakespeare, we want to see traces of those passions in the portrait’s face. Unfortunately, as a flesh-and-blood human being Will Shakespeare of Stratford remains stubbornly out of reach. He was born to an apparently illiterate glove maker and his wife early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. At 18, he married the pregnant Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his senior. By 21, he had fathered three children. He turns up in the documentary record next at age 28 in London – apparently without his family – working as an actor.

His name appears on the title pages of plays printed for popular consumption beginning in his mid-30s. Records show he retired around 1613 and moved back to Stratford, where he died in relative obscurity three years later at 52.

In recent decades, the debate has largely settled down to a dispute between two opposing camps.
In recent decades, the debate has largely settled down to a dispute between two opposing camps. On one side are the mainstream defenders of the status quo, known as Stratfordians. The anti-Stratfordian movement, meanwhile, backed by books, Web sites and conferences, has coalesced mainly around a single candidate: Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford (1550-1604).

It’s certainly curious that the creator of such vivid, recognizably human characters as Falstaff, Lear and Hamlet should himself remain as insubstantial as stage smoke.

(For example, by counting the difference in total words in two passages from Henry IV, Part 1, multiplying that by the number of hyphenations, then using the result to move up or maybe down a page somewhere else, you can begin to extract hidden messages in the plays, such as fetched – a long-dead member of Henry VIII’s court; a cabal of Jesuits – but the very proliferation of theories demonstrated how deeply unsatisfying many people found the Stratford story to be.
Last year, a scientific examination revealed that one of the most familiar likenesses of the playwright, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s so-called Flower portrait – once thought to have been done in the Bard’s lifetime and to have perhaps been the source of the Droeshout engraving – was actually concocted in the 19th century.

Though Cooper can’t affirm that any of the Searching for Shakespeare” portraits were painted from life, she labels as pretty high” the odds that a living, breathing William Shakespeare posed for the National Portrait Gallery’s own Chandos portrait, which she calls our Mona Lisa.” The undated painting is attributed to an obscure English artist and possible bit actor of Shakespeare’s day named John Taylor.

Lots of his early plays are either collaborative works, where he’s a kind of junior partner working with more established dramatists, or they’re reworkings of older plays. ”Even the mature plays like Hamlet and King Lear, Bate says, drew on existing works for their plots. In his time, originality wasn’t especially valued. As for England not mourning his death, that’s not surprising either. By 1616, Shakespeare was, after all, a middle-class retiree living far from London, and his plays were no longer the latest fashion. In his own lifetime and for some time after, Shakespeare is certainly admired and respected, but he’s not thought of as unique,” says Bate. Which is why later writers felt justified in improving” on him.

Not so much as a couplet written in Shakespeare’s own hand has been proven to exist. In fact, there’s no hard evidence that Will Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon (1564-1616), revered as the greatest author in the English language, could even write a complete sentence.

And, they say, playwrights who satirized the powerful too obviously could find themselves jailed or worse. Richard Whalen, author of Shakespeare – Who Was He? (which answers its title’s question as, unquestionably, the Earl of Oxford), allows that the earl’s identity as the real Shakespeare had to have been known to a number of theater-world insiders, among them an accommodating Will.

The only definitive examples of Shakespeare’s handwriting are six signatures, all on legal documents. Of course, few letters or diaries of commoners from that time have survived. Doubters over the years have proposed some 60 candidates as the real Shakespeare, among them Sir Walter Raleigh, Christopher Marlowe and Queen Elizabeth herself. The popular favorite among skeptics of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Francis Bacon, philosopher and writer. Some Baconians maintained that secret codes sprinkled throughout Shakespeare’s plays pointed to the works’ true author.

The anti-Stratfordian movement, meanwhile, backed by books, Web sites and conferences, has coalesced mainly around a single candidate: Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford (1550-1604).

The Greek and Latin classics echoed in the plays were a standard part of the grammar-school curriculum.
The Greek and Latin classics echoed in the plays were a standard part of the grammar-school curriculum. Shakespeare may never have visited Italy, but neither he nor anyone else during the Renaissance ever set foot in ancient Greece or Rome either, and that did not rule out the Classical world as a popular setting for poetry and drama.

The second generally accepted portrait, also posthumous, is a memorial bust in Stratford’s Trinity Church, which many find even more disconcerting than Droeshout’s engraving. Critic J. Dover Wilson likened the well-fed, vacant-looking man in the carving to a self-satisfied pork-butcher. ”The two portraits, Wilson wrote in his 1932 biography The Essential Shakespeare, are so obviously false images of the greatest poet of all time that the world turns from them in disgust. Wilson seems to have been overstating matters, for evidently both likenesses were acceptable to Shakespeare’s own friends and family.

The second generally accepted portrait, also posthumous, is a memorial bust in Stratford’s Trinity Church, which many find even more disconcerting than Droeshout’s engraving. Critic J. Dover Wilson likened the well-fed, vacant-looking man in the carving to a self-satisfied pork-butcher. ”The two portraits, Wilson wrote in his 1932 biography The Essential Shakespeare, are so obviously false images of the greatest poet of all time that the world turns from them in disgust. Wilson seems to have been overstating matters, for evidently both likenesses were acceptable to Shakespeare’s own friends and family.

In 1988, the subject of another rendering, the Folger Shakespeare Library’s Janssen portrait, inscribed with the date 1610, proved to be hiding a full head of hair; the subject’s domelike forehead was a paint-over added in the 17th or 18th century.

The second generally accepted portrait, also posthumous, is a memorial bust in Stratford’s Trinity Church, which many find even more disconcerting than Droeshout’s engraving. Critic J. Dover Wilson likened the well-fed, vacant-looking man in the carving to a self-satisfied pork-butcher. ”The two portraits, Wilson wrote in his 1932 biography The Essential Shakespeare, are so obviously false images of the greatest poet of all time that the world turns from them in disgust. Wilson seems to have been overstating matters, for evidently both likenesses were acceptable to Shakespeare’s own friends and family.

No, a Stratford grammar-school graduate wasn’t akin to a seventh-grade dropout of today. The Greek and Latin classics echoed in the plays were a standard part of the grammar-school curriculum. Shakespeare may never have visited Italy, but neither he nor anyone else during the Renaissance ever set foot in ancient Greece or Rome either, and that did not rule out the Classical world as a popular setting for poetry and drama.

By Doug Stewart Smithsonian magazine September 2006 Even if you’re a regular visitor to London, it’s probably never occurred to you to stop in to see William Shakespeare’s original manuscripts at the British Museum or Library. That’s just as well. There are no original manuscripts. Not so much as a couplet written in Shakespeare’s own hand has been proven to exist.

Though Cooper can’t affirm that any of the Searching for Shakespeare” portraits were painted from life, she labels as pretty high” the odds that a living, breathing William Shakespeare posed for the National Portrait Gallery’s own Chandos portrait, which she calls our Mona Lisa.”
”The two portraits, Wilson wrote in his 1932 biography The Essential Shakespeare, are so obviously false images of the greatest poet of all time that the world turns from them in disgust. Wilson seems to have been overstating matters, for evidently both likenesses were acceptable to Shakespeare’s own friends and family. In the years following these two early efforts at depicting him, Shakespearean portraiture became something of a cottage industry. New portraits turn up quite often,” says curator Tarnya Cooper in London. In the last three months, I’ve had three.” So far, all have been deemed fabrications or portraits of someone else.
