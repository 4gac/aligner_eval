But in showing how she was able to wrestle through her emotions and find peace, it illustrates a similar theme. Neil and I were delighted to find that I was pregnant after only six months of marriage. But one night, just before Christmas, I felt intense pain that grew rapidly worse. Our doctor wanted to send me to the hospital, and our neighbor, a nurse, came to stay with me until we left for town. She confirmed my worst fears – I would probably lose my baby. The emotional pain was at least as severe as the physical.
Andrea, a woman in my church, struggled to accept a much heavier burden: she miscarried three times before having a healthy child.

If he lives, the doctor tells us, he may outgrow the need for these tubes. He is teaching me acceptance every day. In the end, it is this acceptance Gretchen writes of that allows us to "forgive” God. Without it, we are left rebelling against our lot in life, and fighting every cross we feel unjustly forced to bear.

The idea that he was a completely different order of genius from all his contemporaries only begins in the mid-18th century, with the British Empire taking off and literacy growing,” says Bate.

By 1616, Shakespeare was, after all, a middle-class retiree living far from London, and his plays were no longer the latest fashion.

By and large, orthodox Stratfordians – a group that includes the vast majority of historians and English professors with an interest in Shakespeare – dismiss Oxford’s champions as wishful thinkers who ignore or misread historical evidence.
By and large, orthodox Stratfordians – a group that includes the vast majority of historians and English professors with an interest in Shakespeare – dismiss Oxford’s champions as wishful thinkers who ignore or misread historical evidence. It’s natural, they say, that we yearn for traces of our most revered writer – a signed love sonnet on parchment, at least, if not a complete first draft of Macbeth.

Nicholas was born when the Franshams were still living in the United States, and one day as Delf was backing a truckload of firewood into their driveway, two-year-old Nicholas, who was playing outdoors, ran to meet his father. Delf did not see him until it was too late, and ran over him. Katie, Delf’s wife, was busy inside the house when he carried in their little boy, limp in his arms. She remembers: I was beside myself – absolutely frantic – but Delf steadied me. We took Nicholas to our doctor, who was also the coroner, and explained what had happened… There was never any question about forgiving my husband, as I knew I was just as much to blame.
Delf, however, could not forgive himself, and the accident haunted him for years.

Looking back, I remember how his eyes often glistened with tears, and wonder what it was that made them come.

For many people, the problem of guilt cannot be solved with another’s forgiveness, or by any external means at all. For them, peace of mind comes only when they are able to forgive themselves. I first met Delf Fransham in 1953. That was the year he moved from the United States to the remote South American village where I grew up and began to teach at the local school.

Forgiving Ourselves
Forgiving Ourselves Without being forgiven, released from the consequences of what we have done, our capacity to act would, as it were, be confined to a single deed from which we could never recover; we would remain the victims of its consequences forever, not unlike the sorcerer’s apprentice who lacked the magic formula to break the spell.

When we assure a person who has hurt us that we no longer hold anything against him, all he has to do is accept our kindness – at least that is what we might hope.

He was great in comedy and tragedy and history. He could write about the court, and he could write about ordinary people. A play doesn’t have to be autobiographical, Bate suggests, any more than a sonnet has to be confessional. Shakespeare always kept himself well disguised. He didn’t insert his own opinions, and he steered away from the topical controversies of the day. That’s why it’s so easy for directors and filmmakers today to make his plays contemporary. It’s the key to his endurance. Nor, Bate adds, is it necessary to believe that Shakespeare began writing masterpieces as soon as he picked up a quill. There is good evidence that he started by rewriting the works of other dramatists. Lots of his early plays are either collaborative works, where he’s a kind of junior partner working with more established dramatists, or they’re reworkings of older plays.

Alan was quickly admitted to a nearby university hospital, but he was three months old before his problems became clear: he would probably never walk or talk; he was blind; and he had significant abnormalities of the hips, brain, ears, and stomach.

How much more pain can Alan bear? What new hurdles await us? His tracheostomy has taken away the few small adventures we had looked forward to: bottles and the chance to explore solid food. No more gurgles of joy, either, and no more cries of frustration. If he lives, the doctor tells us, he may outgrow the need for these tubes. He is teaching me acceptance every day. In the end, it is this acceptance Gretchen writes of that allows us to "forgive” God. Without it, we are left rebelling against our lot in life, and fighting every cross we feel unjustly forced to bear. With it, we gain the ability to see our hardships in relation to the suffering of others, and strength to carry them. Forgiving Ourselves

How much more suffering will he have to endure? In a world quick to offer "early diagnosis” and abortion as the answer to imperfect babies, Alan’s parents refuse to see their child as a burden.

Then, in an almost unbelievable coincidence, John met Kim during an event at the Vietnam War Memorial on Veterans Day, 1996. Kim had come to Washington, D. C. , to lay a wreath for peace; John had come with a group of former pilots unable to come to terms with their shared past, but determined to stick together anyway. In a speech to the crowd, Kim introduced herself as the girl in the famous photograph.
John Plummer lives the quiet life of a Methodist pastor in a sleepy Virginia town these days, but things weren’t always so. A helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War, he helped organize a napalm raid on the village of Trang Bang in 1972 – a bombing immortalized by the prize-winning photograph of one of its victims, Phan Thi Kim Phuc. For the next twenty-four years, John was haunted by the photograph – an image that for many people captured the essence of the war: a naked and burned nine-year-old running toward the camera, with plumes of black smoke billowing in the sky behind her.

A helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War, he helped organize a napalm raid on the village of Trang Bang in 1972 – a bombing immortalized by the prize-winning photograph of one of its victims, Phan Thi Kim Phuc. For the next twenty-four years, John was haunted by the photograph – an image that for many people captured the essence of the war: a naked and burned nine-year-old running toward the camera, with plumes of black smoke billowing in the sky behind her. For twenty-four years John’s conscience tormented him. He badly wanted to find the girl to tell her that he was sorry – but he could not. Turning in on himself, he grew more and more depressed (the collapse of two marriages didn’t help), and he began to drink.

The words "Weeping shall endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning” especially comforted me, even when I couldn’t feel that joy coming, when it seemed that dawn would never break. Slowly, with time and with the loving help of those around me, I was able to feel that this deeply painful experience had given me an inkling of the love of God, who cares about the suffering of people and who was, I am convinced, right there beside me in my pain. God became more real to me, and I began to trust his love. But then, some months later, when I was expecting another baby and hoping fervently that all would go well, the same thing happened again. Severe pain, an emergency trip to the hospital, and an operation to save my life. Again another precious little person lost just after it had come into being. Deep pain tore my heart apart. I wrote in my diary: "I cannot see why; perhaps I never will. I need the assurance of faith – Help me!"

Once more there was deep pain in my heart, but this time no desperation over why. Today Andrea is the mother of a beautiful six-year-old daughter. Although thinking about her first three pregnancies always brings back a flood of emotions, she is not bitter. In fact, she is even able to point to two good fruits of her anguish: a greater love for her husband, who "went to hell and back with me, ” and endless gratitude for her only child. Like Andrea, Jon and Gretchen Rhoads – a young couple in a nearby community – eagerly awaited the birth of their first child. Alan was born after a seemingly normal pregnancy, and in the beginning everything seemed all right. After he was discharged from the hospital, though, his parents noticed something was wrong.

Nor, Bate adds, is it necessary to believe that Shakespeare began writing masterpieces as soon as he picked up a quill.

A helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War, he helped organize a napalm raid on the village of Trang Bang in 1972 – a bombing immortalized by the prize-winning photograph of one of its victims, Phan Thi Kim Phuc. For the next twenty-four years, John was haunted by the photograph – an image that for many people captured the essence of the war: a naked and burned nine-year-old running toward the camera, with plumes of black smoke billowing in the sky behind her. For twenty-four years John’s conscience tormented him. He badly wanted to find the girl to tell her that he was sorry – but he could not. Turning in on himself, he grew more and more depressed (the collapse of two marriages didn’t help), and he began to drink.

When we assure a person who has hurt us that we no longer hold anything against him, all he has to do is accept our kindness – at least that is what we might hope.

By 1616, Shakespeare was, after all, a middle-class retiree living far from London, and his plays were no longer the latest fashion. In his own lifetime and for some time after, Shakespeare is certainly admired and respected, but he’s not thought of as unique,” says Bate. Which is why later writers felt justified in improving” on him. British poet laureate John Dryden shortened Troilus and Cressida in the late 1600s by excising what he called that heap of Rubbish, under which so many excellent Thoughts lay wholly bury’d.” An unnamed critic in the following century scolded Shakespeare for ignoring the ancients, for violating decorum by resorting to tragicomedy and supernatural characters, and for using puns and blank verse. The idea that he was a completely different order of genius from all his contemporaries only begins in the mid-18th century, with the British Empire taking off and literacy growing,” says Bate. The apotheosis became official with actor David Garrick’s lavish Shakespeare Jubilee, held in Stratford in 1769.
