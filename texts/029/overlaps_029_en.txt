An uninhibited Homeric boasting runs through the book. It must have disturbed the original editors. Much of it has been either toned down or edited out. This can be seen in Flower`s translation, which is based on the version that the Seabhac put together. In the 1929 edition O Crohan says, "I am proud to set down my story and the story of my neighbours." But the original text is: "One other thing,` (a characteristic addition) `there`s not a country or neighbourhood or nation in which one person doesn`t triumph above all others! Tugann an craobh leis." He continues, "Now, from the first time the fire was lit on this island no one has written about its life or its people. That leaves the craobh or the branch of victory with the person who did it." And that is, namely, an t-uasal O Crohan. Then, at the conclusion, with that sure instinct which I find throughout the book, a persistent way of thinking and feeling finding naturally its right expression, he returns to the final dream of eternity, and the last sentence gathers in all the primary characteristics.

It was then, in that pub, when I realised what he’d done, how he must have made that night-raid work, how he must have climbed and crept and fought his way in, with his new body, how he must have been able to vanish, weighed down with specie, that I realised he was something.

As an observant outsider, Synge, notes about the Aran Islanders: The direct sexual instincts are not weak on the island, but they are so subordinated to the instinct of the family that they rarely lead to irregularity.

Dodds generalizes with beautiful simplicity in The Greeks and the Irrational, when he says that "Religion grows out of man`s relationship to his total environment and morals out of his relations to his fellow man." In the moral unit of the family, the parents come first and are inviolate. When Pats’ sons disappear into America, abandoning their father, O Crohan’s shock at the impiety is palpable. This is the worst possible offence, since a son`s life is almost a continuation of the father’s. Brothers and sisters come next in the moral unit, which extends to blood relations and to those linked to the family through marriage, and finally to good neighbours. I was terrified for the boat that had left me and no wonder for some others of my kin were in her and besides even if I had no relation of board a man is often worried about good neighbours.

When the boy drowns himself and they find the body and bring it ashore, it is with a tentativeness, haste and deep unease that he is left with God in Castlepoint. We have come close to the end of a story. We have seen how all things are reduced to their essentials and are immediate and concrete. They only exist insofar as it is necessary to the action.
Each night, Uncle Diarmuid calls to the house in an attempt to lighten trouble with news of worse – a ship lost at sea with hundreds on board, a wall of rock falling on all the workers of a mine – to put hearth in them, to renew their courage. The only thing they seem unable to deal with is madness. Death is a fine thing, O Crohan says, besides certain things that hang over poor sinners.

All mysterious and far-flung places are brought in and reduced to the island frame.

A woman of the Manning family, a marvelous woman, She it was who finished the bailiffs and the drivers who used to come here day after day ruining the poor, who had nothing to live on but famine. A bailiff climbed on to the roof of her house and started knocking it down on her and on to her flock of feeble children. She seized a pair of new shears and opened them – one point this way, the other that. A stout woman and a mad woman! The bailiff never noticed anything till he felt the point of the shears stuck right into his behind.

When he apologises for the waste of a day in Dingle in relief of hardship through drunkenness, there is the physical sense of the day being taken out of the succession of days and squandered like the actual coins in their pockets.

If the interdependence of scene and action serve to reduce one another to bare essentials, I think the strange sense of timelessness that the book has - of being outside time – comes from the day, a single day breaking continually over the scene and the action.

The concerns are immediate: a boon to be won or lost, a constant alertness to take advantage of any sudden windfall – copper bolts from a wrecked ship, barrels of oil, chests of tea; the same alertness to thwart danger – the sudden shock of the shark in the net, the storms; and, presumably, the same alertness throughout a day at sea, to escape drowning.

He has, he says, rescued the days from forgetfulness, those days he has seen with his own eyes and whose burden he has borne, a rabhas ag broc leis, another phrase that cannot be properly rendered into English. Then he looks forward to a dream of eternity, when all this will have vanished, and all that will be left is his account of his own life and the lives of his neighbours, without a bitter word ever having passed between them.

She argues that anybody making an alliance with such a family was taking on a great responsibility and that they would never be in a position to lend much of a hand. She herself had picked an excellent, knowledgeable girl whose people lived in the village and could be relied upon when needed. Once it was arranged, we hear no more about the marriage. It is tombstone writ: `A week from that day we were married, Tomas O Crohan and Maire Keane in the last week of Shrove in the year 1878.`
He was making a point, and my good bloody godsbut I admired that.

Here the family unit brings help once more. Each night, Uncle Diarmuid calls to the house in an attempt to lighten trouble with news of worse – a ship lost at sea with hundreds on board, a wall of rock falling on all the workers of a mine – to put hearth in them, to renew their courage.

The sexual instinct, too, is subordinate to the family. It is a healthy instinct. We see it so in the nights dancing, the uninhibited encounter with the girls on the mountain, and O Crohan boasts that in all his years on the island, in spite of health and youth and long nights, not once did a sexual irregularity occur.

As an observant outsider, Synge, notes about the Aran Islanders: The direct sexual instincts are not weak on the island, but they are so subordinated to the instinct of the family that they rarely lead to irregularity.

When they went without, they tried as best they could to endure. If the strong sense of the day, the endlessly recurring day, gives to the work its timeless quality, this is deepened still more by the fact that people and place seem to stand outside history.

In a famous but not quite accurate remark, Borges argues that a proof of the authenticity of the Koran is that you can find no camels in its pages; they were so taken for granted that there was no need for them to be mentioned.

It is a healthy instinct.

It is with a sense of inevitability that he turns away from the girl of his heart (`The most lovely girl on blessed earth at that time`) and watches the marriage being arranged, as if he were observing a separate person, a person in a drama. What interests him most is the pull and tug of the different family factions as they battle to decide which girl will get him, in the hope that the house will be more useful to them if they can install their own favourite. It is his sister who wins. She persuades the parents that the family `of the most lovely girl on blessed earth` live too far away. They live on Inishvickaullaun, on island a few miles to the south, an eternity away in any emergency. She argues that anybody making an alliance with such a family was taking on a great responsibility and that they would never be in a position to lend much of a hand.

It is tombstone writ: `A week from that day we were married, Tomas O Crohan and Maire Keane in the last week of Shrove in the year 1878.` All we hear afterwards is a catalogue of troubles, his wife`s failing health and death, the deaths of their children.

That was what had people all excited, told them he was something else than your average gangster.

Just at the time that these companies were sending their boats to us, the talk was beginning throughout Ireland about self-government, or Home Rule, as it is called in another language. I often told the fishermen that Home Rule had come to the Irish without their knowing it, and that the first beginning of it had been made in the Blaskets now that the yellow gold of England and France was coming to our threshold to purchase our fish, and we didn`t give a curse for anybody.

When they went without, they tried as best they could to endure. If the strong sense of the day, the endlessly recurring day, gives to the work its timeless quality, this is deepened still more by the fact that people and place seem to stand outside history. The distant rumblings of a new Ireland are brushed aside.
O Crohan never examines why people behave in such and such a manner, why an event turns out one way and not another. What happens is all. The same view is taken of the spending of money. If we had been as careful of the pounds in those days as we have been for some years past, it is my belief that poverty wouldn`t have come upon us so soon. …People say that the wheel is always turning, and that`s true saying, for in the part of the world that I have known it has turned many times; and if the world improved a bit round the Blaskets at that time, and God have us that much good fortune, I fancy we didn`t take the care we should have done of it, for `easy come, easy go` is always the way.

When they went without, they tried as best they could to endure. If the strong sense of the day, the endlessly recurring day, gives to the work its timeless quality, this is deepened still more by the fact that people and place seem to stand outside history. The distant rumblings of a new Ireland are brushed aside. Just at the time that these companies were sending their boats to us, the talk was beginning throughout Ireland about self-government, or Home Rule, as it is called in another language.

O Crohan`s own marriage is made in an identical mode. He was in love, if we can call it such in this context. It is with a sense of inevitability that he turns away from the girl of his heart (`The most lovely girl on blessed earth at that time`) and watches the marriage being arranged, as if he were observing a separate person, a person in a drama.

What interests him most is the pull and tug of the different family factions as they battle to decide which girl will get him, in the hope that the house will be more useful to them if they can install their own favourite.

The following passage could be the material of a novel or a long story running to many pages, by George Moore, say: `Martin lived only a year after his marriage, and then my sister had to return to her own people, for one of Martin`s brothers came back to live with the old people.
Of his son`s death: `We had only one comfort, there was no wound or blemish anywhere on his body though it was a steep fall from a cliff, and we had to put up with it and plough on and be satisfied`; and he leans on the old constant truisms, `those that pass cannot feed those that remain`, and `We too had to put our oars out and drive on.

No two days or two persons are alike. There is no way to foretell what they might bring. To plan ahead is as useless as to look back in regret. Certainly, there are disappointments, but they are always greeted in the same way.

Events, we are told laconically, often turn out differently from what people expect, which is as applicable to an escape from death as it is to sudden good fortune.

What emerges finally is a simple, heroic poetry, not in the sense of any striking metaphor or image; on the contrary, when we come on one towards the end of the book – the `crag in the midst of the great sea, and again and again the blown surf drives right over it` - we are almost inclined to suspend belief, at least to become suspicious, since it is so out of character with the style. The poetry, rather, seeps through the book as a whole, like water or the sea air round the place itself, so persistent is the form of seeing and thinking, and this, equally persistently, seems all the time to fund its right expression.

Did you hear about that Remade done that robbery? someone said to me in a pub. I was careful, couldn’t show any reaction. I’d felt something when I met Jack, you know?

Each night, Uncle Diarmuid calls to the house in an attempt to lighten trouble with news of worse – a ship lost at sea with hundreds on board, a wall of rock falling on all the workers of a mine – to put hearth in them, to renew their courage.

Even mealtimes are conditioned by this law. There are only two meals, the morning and evening meal. One eats enough in the morning to get through the day and restores oneself again at its end.

The distant rumblings of a new Ireland are brushed aside. Just at the time that these companies were sending their boats to us, the talk was beginning throughout Ireland about self-government, or Home Rule, as it is called in another language.

The only thing they seem unable to deal with is madness. Death is a fine thing, O Crohan says, besides certain things that hang over poor sinners. When Diarmuid`s son goes mad, the community appears to be afraid to help or touch the mad one. OCrohan, who is usually so boastful of his readiness to give help, when asked to make up a crew to take the boy to Dingle, says mournfully that at such moments, all one can do is to stand up and be counted.

Unwittingly, through the island frame, we have been introduced into a complete representation of existence. Towards the end of the book, he talks of the actual writing of the book.

The shape and rhythm of the story is completely that of a single day.

Events, we are told laconically, often turn out differently from what people expect, which is as applicable to an escape from death as it is to sudden good fortune.
There is a continual setting out and a returning. The concerns are immediate: a boon to be won or lost, a constant alertness to take advantage of any sudden windfall – copper bolts from a wrecked ship, barrels of oil, chests of tea; the same alertness to thwart danger – the sudden shock of the shark in the net, the storms; and, presumably, the same alertness throughout a day at sea, to escape drowning.

There were donkeys on the island but they are only twice mentioned. They would not have appeared at all, had not a creel been blown out to sea off one of them when drawing home the turf, and when the bailiffs came to seize property, all they could find was an old donkey at the other end of the island with nothing alive but the two eyes in the head.

They would not have appeared at all, had not a creel been blown out to sea off one of them when drawing home the turf, and when the bailiffs came to seize property, all they could find was an old donkey at the other end of the island with nothing alive but the two eyes in the head.

If the interdependence of scene and action serve to reduce one another to bare essentials, I think the strange sense of timelessness that the book has - of being outside time – comes from the day, a single day breaking continually over the scene and the action.

What emerges finally is a simple, heroic poetry, not in the sense of any striking metaphor or image; on the contrary, when we come on one towards the end of the book – the `crag in the midst of the great sea, and again and again the blown surf drives right over it` - we are almost inclined to suspend belief, at least to become suspicious, since it is so out of character with the style.

This is the worst possible offence, since a son`s life is almost a continuation of the father’s. Brothers and sisters come next in the moral unit, which extends to blood relations and to those linked to the family through marriage, and finally to good neighbours.

Then he looks forward to a dream of eternity, when all this will have vanished, and all that will be left is his account of his own life and the lives of his neighbours, without a bitter word ever having passed between them. An uninhibited Homeric boasting runs through the book. It must have disturbed the original editors. Much of it has been either toned down or edited out. This can be seen in Flower`s translation, which is based on the version that the Seabhac put together. In the 1929 edition O Crohan says, "I am proud to set down my story and the story of my neighbours." But the original text is: "One other thing,` (a characteristic addition) `there`s not a country or neighbourhood or nation in which one person doesn`t triumph above all others! Tugann an craobh leis." He continues, "Now, from the first time the fire was lit on this island no one has written about its life or its people.

Then, at the conclusion, with that sure instinct which I find throughout the book, a persistent way of thinking and feeling finding naturally its right expression, he returns to the final dream of eternity, and the last sentence gathers in all the primary characteristics.

We hear the clear tone of exasperation. This makes no human or island sense. You might think there was something in what he said.

We see it so in the nights dancing, the uninhibited encounter with the girls on the mountain, and O Crohan boasts that in all his years on the island, in spite of health and youth and long nights, not once did a sexual irregularity occur.

As an observant outsider, Synge, notes about the Aran Islanders: The direct sexual instincts are not weak on the island, but they are so subordinated to the instinct of the family that they rarely lead to irregularity.

Well, I don’t want to be too sentimental about itbutI’ve no doubts at all that Jack’d have seen this woman— whose hands yes were gone and been replaced with little birds’ wings—and he’d have seen an old man, not the sexless thing he’d been made into, and a young lad with eyes gone and in their place an array of dark glass and pipework and lights and the boy stumbling trying to see in ways he weren’t born to but still a boy.

What emerges finally is a simple, heroic poetry, not in the sense of any striking metaphor or image; on the contrary, when we come on one towards the end of the book – the `crag in the midst of the great sea, and again and again the blown surf drives right over it` - we are almost inclined to suspend belief, at least to become suspicious, since it is so out of character with the style.

We see it so in the nights dancing, the uninhibited encounter with the girls on the mountain, and O Crohan boasts that in all his years on the island, in spite of health and youth and long nights, not once did a sexual irregularity occur.
When Pats’ sons disappear into America, abandoning their father, O Crohan’s shock at the impiety is palpable. This is the worst possible offence, since a son`s life is almost a continuation of the father’s. Brothers and sisters come next in the moral unit, which extends to blood relations and to those linked to the family through marriage, and finally to good neighbours.

As an observant outsider, Synge, notes about the Aran Islanders: The direct sexual instincts are not weak on the island, but they are so subordinated to the instinct of the family that they rarely lead to irregularity.

If the interdependence of scene and action serve to reduce one another to bare essentials, I think the strange sense of timelessness that the book has - of being outside time – comes from the day, a single day breaking continually over the scene and the action.

It can be seen by now, how the individual is left very much to his own devices in a setting provided mostly by nature. His concerns are always near, a living to be won or lost, some small advantage to be gained. They live hardly differently to beasts, always at the mercy of what the day may bring; but custom brings is to the social, and here again we find the same view of reality, the same simplicity of form conditioned by the same necessity.

`In the running of my days` is Flower`s literal translation, but it has, I feel, more of the sense of a great tide filling the strand with the vigour and glory of youth, coming to a fullness, and then gradually and weakly withdrawing.

…People say that the wheel is always turning, and that`s true saying, for in the part of the world that I have known it has turned many times; and if the world improved a bit round the Blaskets at that time, and God have us that much good fortune, I fancy we didn`t take the care we should have done of it, for `easy come, easy go` is always the way.
