People know right then and there what’s happened, but when the man wakes up and gets unstitched he starts raving, describing the man who done this to him, and then it’s certain.
And when he quieted, I spoke again.

Some people said he was laughing. Bright daylight—militia visible in uniform. That’s a thing in itself. He went by the Ribs, they say, even scrambled up the bones, though of course I don’t believe that. But wherever he went, I see him sure-footed on the slates, a famous outlaw man by then, and behind him a wake of clodhopping militia, and streaks in the sky as they fire.

Impressive for all that but a desperate bloody crawl, his new Remaking still atwitch, all grimy, all stained by the grease of his shackles, and stonedust, lying in some haul of rubbish where the dogs couldn’t smell him, till he was strong enough to run.

I’m not clear on the details. But the point is what Jack done. One day the workers troop in and they take their places by the gears, but there’s no klaxon. And they’re waiting, but nothing happens. Now they’re getting wary, they’re getting very antsy. They know it’s that overseer who’s due in that day, so they’re nervous, they ain’t talking much, but they go looking. And there at the foot of the steps up to the office, there’s an arrow put together out of tools.

He’d been caught for his own little crimes—his own paltry, petty, pathetic misdemeanours—and he thought if he delivered Jack, the government would look after him, forgive him and keep him safe. Idiot man. He thought the government would keep him out of our hands. Most of what Jack did weren’t so obviously dramatic, of course. It was the smaller, savager stuff that had them out for him. It ain’t that they were happy about the big swaggering thievery, the showings-off. But that ain’t what made Jack a thorn they had to pluck.
I don’t know how it was uptown in The Crow—I expect the well-dressed there sneered, or made a show of not caring—but where the houses lean in to each other, where the bricks shed pointing, in the shadow of the glass cactus ghetto, people walked tall.

I don’t know where you live. If it’s Dog Fenn, then knowing that Parliament’s a building like nothing else, or that we’ve riches in the coffers that would make the rest of the world jealous, or that the scholars of New Crobuzon could outthink the bloody gods—knowing all of that doesn’t do so much.

If you’re fighting the sickness of society, and make no mistake that’s what we do, then sometimes you have to use harsh methods, but you don’t relish it, or it’ll taint you. You do what has to be done. Most of the time.

If it’s Dog Fenn, then knowing that Parliament’s a building like nothing else, or that we’ve riches in the coffers that would make the rest of the world jealous, or that the scholars of New Crobuzon could outthink the bloody gods—knowing all of that doesn’t do so much.

That, I think, would have been as messy as any other birth. No, the escape I’m talking about was the one they call Jack’s Steeplechase. Even now people can’t decide whether it was deliberate or not, whether he let it out to the militia that he’d be there, that he’d be stealing weapons from one of their caches, in the city centre, in Perdido Street Station, just so they’d come for him and he could show he could get away from them. Me I don’t think he’d be so cocky. I think he just got caught, but being who he was, being what he was, he made the best of it. He ran for a more than an hour. You can go a long way in that time, over the roofs of New Crobuzon. Within fifteen minutes news had spread and I don’t know how, I don’t know how it is that the news of him running moved faster than he did himself, but that’s the way of these things.

Soon enough, as Jack Half-a-Prayer tore into view over some street, he’d find people waiting, and as far as they dared, cheering.

But there would always be documents, somewhere close by or left for journalists or the community, that proved the victim was militia. Awful wounds on both sides of their necks, as ifragged, serrated scissors had half closed on them. Jack the Remade, using what the city gave him. That wasn’t alright.
It ain’t that they were happy about the big swaggering thievery, the showings-off. But that ain’t what made Jack a thorn they had to pluck. No one knows how he got the information he did, but Jack could smell militia like a hound. No matter how good their cover.

It can be harsh.

It was a basic Remaking.

It’s easy to see why the city would want them. But I can’t explain to you the woman given a ruff of peacock feathers, or the young lad with iron spiderlimbs out his back, or those with too many eyes or engines that make them burn from the inside out, or legs made wooden toys or replaced with the arms of apes so they walk with mad monkey grace.

But it’s sort of an untrue truth, for a lot of us. I don’t know where you live. If it’s Dog Fenn, then knowing that Parliament’s a building like nothing else, or that we’ve riches in the coffers that would make the rest of the world jealous, or that the scholars of New Crobuzon could outthink the bloody gods—knowing all of that doesn’t do so much. You still live in Dog Fenn, or Badside, or what have you. But when Jack ran, the city was the greatest for Badside too. You could see it—I could see it—in the way people walked, after Jack’d done something. I don’t know how it was uptown in The Crow—I expect the well-dressed there sneered, or made a show of not caring—but where the houses lean in to each other, where the bricks shed pointing, in the shadow of the glass cactus ghetto, people walked tall.

I’m grateful to Jack and his kin.

In Salacus Fields they’d toast Jack by name. I wouldn’t do that, of course—not that I didn’t want to, but you can imagine, in the business I’m in, I have to be careful. I’m involved, so of course I can’t be seen to be. In my head, though, I’d raise a glass with them. To Jack, I’d think. In the short time I worked with Jack I never used his given name, nor he mine. It’s in the nature of the work, obviously, that you don’t use real names.
Jack was going too far.

Falling, chasing, falling, more emerging from attics, from stairways, from all over, wearing their masks, pointing weapons, and firing them, and Jack leaping over chimneypots and launching himself from dormers, leaving them behind. Some people said he was laughing. Bright daylight—militia visible in uniform. That’s a thing in itself. He went by the Ribs, they say, even scrambled up the bones, though of course I don’t believe that. But wherever he went, I see him sure-footed on the slates, a famous outlaw man by then, and behind him a wake of clodhopping militia, and streaks in the sky as they fire.

No one knows how he got the information he did, but Jack could smell militia like a hound. No matter how good their cover.
No one knows how he got the information he did, but Jack could smell militia like a hound. No matter how good their cover. Informers, colonel-informers, intriguists, provocateurs, insiders and officers—Jack could find them, no matter that their neighbours had always thought they were just retired clerks, or artists, or tramps, or perfume-sellers, or loners.

No, the escape I’m talking about was the one they call Jack’s Steeplechase.
No, the escape I’m talking about was the one they call Jack’s Steeplechase. Even now people can’t decide whether it was deliberate or not, whether he let it out to the militia that he’d be there, that he’d be stealing weapons from one of their caches, in the city centre, in Perdido Street Station, just so they’d come for him and he could show he could get away from them.

Not his first escape—that I can’t help thinking would have been some tawdry affair.
Not his first escape—that I can’t help thinking would have been some tawdry affair. Impressive for all that but a desperate bloody crawl, his new Remaking still atwitch, all grimy, all stained by the grease of his shackles, and stonedust, lying in some haul of rubbish where the dogs couldn’t smell him, till he was strong enough to run.

That man was lucky he didn’t get killed, is my thinking. There was no more trouble there for a while, I hear. That changed things. I think they called that one Jack’s Whispering Stitch. It’s things like that make you see why people respected Jack Half-a-Prayer. Loved him.

So they creep up. And on the landing there’s another. And there’s a whole gang of men now, and they’re following these arrows, soldered to the banisters, up on the walkway, trooping round the factory, until pretty much the whole workforce is up there, and they come to the end of the gangway, and there dangling is that supervisor.

Don’t get me wrong, I like my colleagues, some of them, they’re good lads, and for all I know some would even agree with the way I look at things, but you just can’t risk it. You have to know when to keep secrets. So I stay well out of it. I don’t talk politics, I just do what I’m told, stay well out of any discussions. When you see, when you see how people looked up after Jack had struck, though, my gods. How could anyone not be for that?

Soon enough, as Jack Half-a-Prayer tore into view over some street, he’d find people waiting, and as far as they dared, cheering.

Falling, chasing, falling, more emerging from attics, from stairways, from all over, wearing their masks, pointing weapons, and firing them, and Jack leaping over chimneypots and launching himself from dormers, leaving them behind.

Suddenly, take a wrong turn by the law and it ain’t just the physical punishment, it ain’t just the new limbs or metal or the change in the body, it’s that they wake up and they’re Remade, the same as they spat on or ignored for years.

Even now people can’t decide whether it was deliberate or not, whether he let it out to the militia that he’d be there, that he’d be stealing weapons from one of their caches, in the city centre, in Perdido Street Station, just so they’d come for him and he could show he could get away from them.

That wasn’t alright.

That wasn’t alright. It wasn’t alright for Jack to think he could touch the functionaries of the government. I know that’s how they thought. That’s when it became imperative that they bring him down.

That would be much worse.
That would be much worse. So here’s a cheer for Jack Half-a-Prayer.

That, I think, would have been as messy as any other birth.

That, I think, would have been as messy as any other birth. No, the escape I’m talking about was the one they call Jack’s Steeplechase. Even now people can’t decide whether it was deliberate or not, whether he let it out to the militia that he’d be there, that he’d be stealing weapons from one of their caches, in the city centre, in Perdido Street Station, just so they’d come for him and he could show he could get away from them.

That’s a thing in itself. He went by the Ribs, they say, even scrambled up the bones, though of course I don’t believe that. But wherever he went, I see him sure-footed on the slates, a famous outlaw man by then, and behind him a wake of clodhopping militia, and streaks in the sky as they fire.

I wonder how many in that crowd were known to him. I heard that it went a bit wrong for the Mayor, that the crowds never jeered or threw muck at the stocks. People loved Jack. Why would I want to see him like that? I know how I want to remember him.

If Jack gives people a reason to keep going, they should have it. So long as it don’t get out of hand, which, of course, it always does. That’s why he had to be stopped. But there’ll be another one, with more big shows, more grand gestures and thefts and the like. People need that. I’m grateful to Jack and his kin. If they weren’t there, and this is what I think my mates don’t understand, if they weren’t there, and all them angry people in Dog Fenn and Kelltree and Smog Bend had no one to cheer on, gods know what they’d do.

You have to know when to keep secrets.
