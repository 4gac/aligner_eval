i am the prince of the sunny valleys
at cool temperatures the peptide portion curls up on itself
this is in fact the same principle used to leaven bread and cakes
in this type of liposome delivery system the gas bubbles created inside the membrane build up pressure and distort the arrangement of the membrane bilayers
as the carbon dioxide bubbles permeate the lipid bilayer the compartmentalized drug is quickly released
the bubbles not only create the necessary defects in the lipid bilayer enabling the drug to escape they also help yield clearer results in ultrasound guided tissue imaging
