A few years ago you couldn’t use the term plant behavior in accepted journals, but now the concept of plant behavior is not controversial anymore, says Baluska.
A few years ago you couldn’t use the term plant behavior in accepted journals, but now the concept of plant behavior is not controversial anymore, says Baluska. Gagliano believes we tend not to credit plants with intelligence simply out of habit, because most of us remain plant blind: If you want to see plants as something that can never do anything purposefully,  she says, that’s what you are going to see.

The plants that have been warned, even though not stressed themselves, will start sending signals about the impending drought to those farther away, encouraging them to prepare for the hard times.

After 60 falls, the plants completely ignored the experience. Even a month later, they still remembered that being dropped was harmless and would not bother to fold their leaves. But if the scientists vigorously shook the mimosa pots instead of dropping them, the plants rapidly closed their leaves to protect themselves from danger, showing it was not just simple fatigue that made them indifferent to the fall.

These are direct pipelines from plant to plant, like a telephone wire, says Suzanne Simard, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia who studies mycorrhizal networks. The first study to clearly show plants do indeed talk through that underground network was done in 2013 by scientists based in the United Kingdom.
Afterward, they allowed the stressed plants to grow peacefully and reproduce in a comfortable 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit. But when the tissues of the next generation were tested, they had differentially expressed genes — clear signs of epigenetic memory — even though they themselves had never experienced a hot spell.

After analyzing all the data, the researchers were able to establish that the seedlings recognized each other by body shape: The plants’ light receptors could sense different patterns of red to far-red light and blue light visible around and reflected off of the other seedlings, creating a profile of each plant.

For Gagliano, that particular experiment, published in Scientific Reports in late 2016, showed not only that plants can learn by association — which is astounding in itself — but also how easily humans underestimate plants.
And the little pea plants learned. Depending on the treatment, the plants knew exactly what the fan meant, Gagliano says. Based on maze studies involving animals, the typical subjects for this type of experiment, Gagliano and colleagues expected the peas to grow randomly, which is the standard research assumption — for animals. Their initial model didn’t take into account that peas have their own system and will always grow toward light.

In a classic 1983 study, when leaves of some trees were damaged, their healthy neighbors emitted more phenolics and tannins — their natural insect repellents — in response, as if they themselves were under an attack.

These cells are highly specialized for sampling and processing information and then directing the root growth, he says. And they are very similar to our neurons. In a way, it makes perfect sense that plants would have their brains in the soil. Soil is a tough place to be. It’s a very difficult task for the root to find nutrition there, Baluska says. At least 20 physical parameters — such as temperature, humidity or levels of heavy metals — are continuously sampled and analyzed.

Until I saw my peas doing their thing, the standard, hypothetical assumption of 50/50 random choice was all I could see, and what most scientists would see because of our own learned conditioning, funny enough, says Gagliano.

Researchers have long known plants can communicate with each other through the release of volatile compounds in the air; studies have now shown an underground system of roots and fungi, called the mycorrhizal network, can also carry signals from one plant to the next.

The next time you go to a forest, Simard says, take a deep breath and sniff the air. What you are smelling is the language of trees. We can tune in to some of their conversations, because many of the volatile compounds that plants use in communication have odors, she says. In a classic 1983 study, when leaves of some trees were damaged, their healthy neighbors emitted more phenolics and tannins — their natural insect repellents — in response, as if they themselves were under an attack. The obvious question is whether the plants are really talking, or if they’re just eavesdropping on what is happening with the others.
But the unplugged plants remained unaware of the danger and did not produce the specific aphid defense.

After all, if a plant being devoured by an insect is emitting defensive chemicals that are later detected by another plant, it doesn’t necessarily mean the first plant had any intention of warning others.

Plant Chat. Just like humans, plants have many ways of figuring outwhat’s happening in their environment. And if they can’t rely on their memories to compare experiences, they can always chat with others to find out what’s going on through the mycorrhizal network, an underground system that connects roots of plants and conducts signals through interwoven bodies of fungi.

For a plant, there are two reasons to recognize a relative, says Susan Dudley, plant biologist at McMaster University in Ontario. One is to avoid mating with them, and the other is to benefit from the relationship. Competition can be costly. So whom do you trust? Your relatives share your genes, so in a way their success is your success. It’s basically nepotism. In one of Dudley’s experiments, Arabidopsis thaliana plants sampled chemicals coming from the roots of their siblings.

Their initial model didn’t take into account that peas have their own system and will always grow toward light. Until I saw my peas doing their thing, the standard, hypothetical assumption of 50/50 random choice was all I could see, and what most scientists would see because of our own learned conditioning, funny enough, says Gagliano. The peas taught me how to see beyond my own training and conditioned assumptions. For Gagliano, that particular experiment, published in Scientific Reports in late 2016, showed not only that plants can learn by association — which is astounding in itself — but also how easily humans underestimate plants. We are plant blind, she says.
For the third group, acting as a control, there was no association between the fan and the light. And the little pea plants learned.

Gagliano believes we tend not to credit plants with intelligence simply out of habit, because most of us remain plant blind: If you want to see plants as something that can never do anything purposefully,  she says, that’s what you are going to see.

After analyzing all the data, the researchers were able to establish that the seedlings recognized each other by body shape: The plants’ light receptors could sense different patterns of red to far-red light and blue light visible around and reflected off of the other seedlings, creating a profile of each plant. Think of it in broad terms, the way you can pick out a friend walking toward you in a crowd, even if the light is in your eyes and you can’t see her facial features. For the seedlings, if a similarly shaped relative was detected, nepotism kicked in: The plant would grow its leaves away from the family member to avoid shading it.

After analyzing all the data, the researchers were able to establish that the seedlings recognized each other by body shape: The plants’ light receptors could sense different patterns of red to far-red light and blue light visible around and reflected off of the other seedlings, creating a profile of each plant. Think of it in broad terms, the way you can pick out a friend walking toward you in a crowd, even if the light is in your eyes and you can’t see her facial features. For the seedlings, if a similarly shaped relative was detected, nepotism kicked in: The plant would grow its leaves away from the family member to avoid shading it. In addition to talking to each other, recognizing relatives and remembering stressful events, some plants can even count. Take the Venus’ flytrap, a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of the Carolinas. When a fly lands inside the trap, the leaves shut, and the plant begins to digest its prey. Experiments published in 2016 showed the plant counts how many times the victim touches sensory hairs on the outer surface of the trap, initially to confirm the catch is something that moves, and therefore edible.

What’s more, plants inherit their language from parents — so speaking the same dialect helps them also recognize relatives.

Experiments in 2014 on sagebrush showed some plants spoke a language dominated by camphor compounds, while others emitted more thujone, coincidentally the same chemical suspected to be responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of absinthe.

Just like humans, plants have many ways of figuring outwhat’s happening in their environment. And if they can’t rely on their memories to compare experiences, they can always chat with others to find out what’s going on through the mycorrhizal network, an underground system that connects roots of plants and conducts signals through interwoven bodies of fungi.

But when the tissues of the next generation were tested, they had differentially expressed genes — clear signs of epigenetic memory — even though they themselves had never experienced a hot spell.
Mice, for example, can inherit fearful memories from their parents through changes in how their genes are expressed, without any changes to the DNA itself. The same may hold true for plants. In 2015, a group of Canadian scientists published the results of an experiment on Indian colza plants, relatives of turnips that are cultivated in India for their oil-rich seeds.

And if they can’t rely on their memories to compare experiences, they can always chat with others to find out what’s going on through the mycorrhizal network, an underground system that connects roots of plants and conducts signals through interwoven bodies of fungi.

But when the tissues of the next generation were tested, they had differentially expressed genes — clear signs of epigenetic memory — even though they themselves had never experienced a hot spell.
Other studies hint that memory in plants may be epigenetic in nature. Mice, for example, can inherit fearful memories from their parents through changes in how their genes are expressed, without any changes to the DNA itself. The same may hold true for plants.

Plant Chat. Just like humans, plants have many ways of figuring outwhat’s happening in their environment. And if they can’t rely on their memories to compare experiences, they can always chat with others to find out what’s going on through the mycorrhizal network, an underground system that connects roots of plants and conducts signals through interwoven bodies of fungi.

She and her colleagues from the University of Western Australia and University of Firenze in Italy did something more radical to the mimosa plants than stroking their leaves: They dropped them from heights. The researchers let them fall 6 inches, far enough to cause the plants to fold their leaves. It happened after the first drop, and the second, and the third. But by the fourth go, the mimosa leaves weren’t as eager to close. After 60 falls, the plants completely ignored the experience. Even a month later, they still remembered that being dropped was harmless and would not bother to fold their leaves.

In 2014, Gagliano chose a different species to study plant memory: Mimosa pudica, famed for its sensitivity to touch. If you brush a leaf of a mimosa with your fingers, it will fold almost instantly. She and her colleagues from the University of Western Australia and University of Firenze in Italy did something more radical to the mimosa plants than stroking their leaves: They dropped them from heights. The researchers let them fall 6 inches, far enough to cause the plants to fold their leaves. It happened after the first drop, and the second, and the third. But by the fourth go, the mimosa leaves weren’t as eager to close. After 60 falls, the plants completely ignored the experience.

Researchers have long known plants can communicate with each other through the release of volatile compounds in the air; studies have now shown an underground system of roots and fungi, called the mycorrhizal network, can also carry signals from one plant to the next.

The plant can judge, by simply counting the number of action potentials spreading over the trap, whether useless dead material has landed inside it or if useful animal prey has been caught, says Sönke Scherzer, an electrophysiologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany, and one of the study’s co-authors.

The more related the plants are, the more similar their language, and the easier it is for them to communicate. Experiments in 2014 on sagebrush showed some plants spoke a language dominated by camphor compounds, while others emitted more thujone, coincidentally the same chemical suspected to be responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of absinthe.

In a classic 1983 study, when leaves of some trees were damaged, their healthy neighbors emitted more phenolics and tannins — their natural insect repellents — in response, as if they themselves were under an attack.

The obvious question is whether the plants are really talking, or if they’re just eavesdropping on what is happening with the others.
The obvious question is whether the plants are really talking, or if they’re just eavesdropping on what is happening with the others. After all, if a plant being devoured by an insect is emitting defensive chemicals that are later detected by another plant, it doesn’t necessarily mean the first plant had any intention of warning others.

The plant can judge, by simply counting the number of action potentials spreading over the trap, whether useless dead material has landed inside it or if useful animal prey has been caught, says Sönke Scherzer, an electrophysiologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany, and one of the study’s co-authors.

Counting also includes some kind of memory, since the plant must remember — at least for a certain time interval — how many action potentials have been evoked before.

Until I saw my peas doing their thing, the standard, hypothetical assumption of 50/50 random choice was all I could see, and what most scientists would see because of our own learned conditioning, funny enough, says Gagliano.

A second group of beans was aphid-free, but connected to the plants under attack via the root network.
These are direct pipelines from plant to plant, like a telephone wire, says Suzanne Simard, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia who studies mycorrhizal networks.

Researchers have long known plants can communicate with each other through the release of volatile compounds in the air; studies have now shown an underground system of roots and fungi, called the mycorrhizal network, can also carry signals from one plant to the next.

No matter where the brains of plants might be located — if they exist at all, that is, since the idea remains controversial — plenty of behavioral studies show they are far more brainy than we tend to assume.

To test whether the fava plants were truly communicating through the roots, the researchers covered all three groups of plants in polyester bags, preventing them from talking via airborne chemicals — another way plants can exchange information.

After all, if a plant being devoured by an insect is emitting defensive chemicals that are later detected by another plant, it doesn’t necessarily mean the first plant had any intention of warning others.

We are plant blind, she says. In 1880, Charles Darwin theorized that plants have special cells devoted to processing information and making decisions about root growth, similar to a brain. Yet it was only in the 1990s that Frantisek Baluska, a plant cell biologist at the University of Bonn in Germany, began proving Darwin’s theory. Baluska admits that he was once plant blind, too.
Until I saw my peas doing their thing, the standard, hypothetical assumption of 50/50 random choice was all I could see, and what most scientists would see because of our own learned conditioning, funny enough, says Gagliano.

The plant can judge, by simply counting the number of action potentials spreading over the trap, whether useless dead material has landed inside it or if useful animal prey has been caught, says Sönke Scherzer, an electrophysiologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany, and one of the study’s co-authors. Counting also includes some kind of memory, since the plant must remember — at least for a certain time interval — how many action potentials have been evoked before.
When a fly lands inside the trap, the leaves shut, and the plant begins to digest its prey. Experiments published in 2016 showed the plant counts how many times the victim touches sensory hairs on the outer surface of the trap, initially to confirm the catch is something that moves, and therefore edible.

The researchers placed seedlings under a maze made out of plumbing pipes; the growing pea had to make a choice each time it hit a fork in the road whether to go left or right.
