Smith, and Kelli White; and middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs); boxer Shane Mosely; and cyclist Tammy Thomas.
Above, Ben Johnson in action during the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the 100-m race before being stripped of his medal and record for illegal drug use. By the 2000s, the true extent of drug use in elite athletes was coming out. In 2003 (the year Major League Baseball introduced its first steroid policy), the BALCO Affair exploded. The Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative in Burlingame, California, marketed a then- undetectable designer steroid, terahydrogestrinone (THG, known as The Clear). Shortly after, a test for THG was developed, and 550 existing urine samples from athletes were tested; 20 tested positive. THG, it emerged, had been used by a number of high-profile sports stars.

Literally hundreds of athletes were tested hundreds if not thousands of times in a variety of sports and never got caught, says Dr Yesalis.

John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone.

In football and baseball, drugs were often introduced by team coaches, trainers, and doctors as well as players. As one doctor with the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team told Sports Illustrated in 1969, We occasionally use Dexamyl and Dexedrine [amphetamines]… We also used barbiturates, Seconal, Tuinal, Nembutal… We also used some antidepressants, Triavil, Tofranil, Valium.

He [a team official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine. Above, San Diego Chargers' defensive tackle Ernie Ladd in 1963. Ladd was the largest player of his time: 6 feet 9 inches and 315 pounds, with a 52-inch chest, 39-inch waist, 20-inch biceps, 19-inch neck, and size 18D shoes. In 1928, the IAAF first attempted to ban athletes for doping, but without reliable drug tests, officials had to rely on the honor system.

Above, the Soviet Union's Tamara Press wins the gold medal in the shot put, setting a new Olympic record for the event in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In football and baseball, drugs were often introduced by team coaches, trainers, and doctors as well as players. As one doctor with the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team told Sports Illustrated in 1969, We occasionally use Dexamyl and Dexedrine [amphetamines]… We also used barbiturates, Seconal, Tuinal, Nembutal…

Above, Pervitin, an amphetamine in use during World War II. British troops alone got 72 million amphetamine tablets during the war. According to one report, RAF pilots got so many it was said that Methedrine won the Battle of Britain. In the 1950s, the Soviet Olympic team experimented with testosterone supplements to increase strength and power. From 1974, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) sports federation had a mandatory state doping policy for athletes as young as 10, often without their knowledge. By 1978, East German athletes in every sport except sailing were receiving anabolic steroids.

John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone. Deciding that US athletes needed a chemical edge to remain competitive, Dr Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol), which appeared on the market in 1960. The weight- and strength-gaining results were so impressive that steroid use quickly spread from weightlifters to other athletes.

But when a subsequent drug test found the steroid stanozolol in his urine, he was stripped of his gold medal; the world-record title went to American sprinter Carl Lewis, the runner-up. In 2003, however, it was revealed that Lewis was among those who had failed drug tests at the 1988 Olympic trials—he had tested positive for banned stimulants and bronchodilators—and should have been disqualified.
In 1968, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) introduced drug testing at both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Anabolic steroids were banned in 1976, after a reliable test was developed, and in the late 1970s, doping-related disqualifications, particularly in strength-related sports, markedly increased. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, news of drug use in sport was relegated to the sports pages of newspapers, if it was reported at all. The practice had not public scandal.

The weight- and strength-gaining results were so impressive that steroid use quickly spread from weightlifters to other athletes. Above, one of Doc Ziegler's star lifters, Ike Berger, shown here at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. At a body weight of 130 pounds, he was kilo for kilo the strongest man in the world. Anabolic steroid use was thought to be limited in the 1960 Olympic Games, but by the 1964 Games, the startling improvement in many strength athletes was impossible to ignore. Soon steroids were being extensively used by athletes in all strength sports. By the mid-1960s, most top-ranking shot-putters and discus, javelin, and hammer throwers were taking steroids. By 1968, sprinters, hurdlers, and middle-distance runners had joined them.

Soon steroids were being extensively used by athletes in all strength sports. By the mid-1960s, most top-ranking shot-putters and discus, javelin, and hammer throwers were taking steroids. By 1968, sprinters, hurdlers, and middle-distance runners had joined them. At the 1968 pre-Olympic training camp, an estimated one third of the entire US track and field team had used steroids. Said a US weightlifting team doctor, I don't think it is possible for a weight man to compete internationally without using anabolic steroids.

Drugs work, Dr Yesalis concedes. If you train naturally for a hundred years, as far as your strength and physicality, you'll never get to the place that you can with some of these drugs.

THG, it emerged, had been used by a number of high-profile sports stars. They included Major League Baseball players (Barry Bonds, Bobby Estalella, Jeremy Giambi, Amando Rios, and Benito Santiago); National Football League players (Chris Cooper, Bill Romanowski, Barrett Robbins, Dana Stubblefield, and Tyrone Wheatley, all of the Oakland Raiders); track and field athletes (hammer thrower John McEwen; shot putters CJ Hunter and Kevin Toth; and sprinters Zhanna Block, Dwain Chambers, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery, Raymond J. Smith, and Kelli White; and middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs); boxer Shane Mosely; and cyclist Tammy Thomas.

John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone.

Deciding that US athletes needed a chemical edge to remain competitive, Dr Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol), which appeared on the market in 1960.
