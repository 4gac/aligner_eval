They included Major League Baseball players (Barry Bonds, Bobby Estalella, Jeremy Giambi, Amando Rios, and Benito Santiago); National Football League players (Chris Cooper, Bill Romanowski, Barrett Robbins, Dana Stubblefield, and Tyrone Wheatley, all of the Oakland Raiders); track and field athletes (hammer thrower John McEwen; shot putters CJ Hunter and Kevin Toth; and sprinters Zhanna Block, Dwain Chambers, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery, Raymond J. Smith, and Kelli White; and middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs); boxer Shane Mosely; and cyclist Tammy Thomas.

By the 2000s, the true extent of drug use in elite athletes was coming out. In 2003 (the year Major League Baseball introduced its first steroid policy), the BALCO Affair exploded.

But, he added, I don't think the use of drugs is as prevalent in the Midwest as it is on the East and West Coasts. A former San Diego Charger told a California legislative committee on drug abuse in 1970, We had to take them [steroids] at lunchtime. He [a team official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine.

Soon steroids were being extensively used by athletes in all strength sports. By the mid-1960s, most top-ranking shot-putters and discus, javelin, and hammer throwers were taking steroids. By 1968, sprinters, hurdlers, and middle-distance runners had joined them. At the 1968 pre-Olympic training camp, an estimated one third of the entire US track and field team had used steroids. Said a US weightlifting team doctor, I don't think it is possible for a weight man to compete internationally without using anabolic steroids. Above, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Mr Olympia and Mr Universe. He admitted taking steroids in a 1977 interview.

A medical team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, recalled Olympic pentathlete gold medal winner Mary Peters, only to discover there were so few who weren't taking them that they couldn't establish any worthwhile comparisons. Some athletes were taking 10 - 100 mg of steroids a day. Above, the Soviet Union's Tamara Press wins the gold medal in the shot put, setting a new Olympic record for the event in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In football and baseball, drugs were often introduced by team coaches, trainers, and doctors as well as players. As one doctor with the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team told Sports Illustrated in 1969, We occasionally use Dexamyl and Dexedrine [amphetamines]â€¦ We also used barbiturates, Seconal, Tuinal, Nembutalâ€¦
Cycling has been drug-ridden since its inception in the 19th century and played a key role in the explosion of stimulant use after World War II.

Everybody used amphetamines, he recalls. During the war, to help morale, there were Army football teams, Navy boxing matches, and other sporting events. Participants used amphetamines and found, Wow, these things really work well. After they came home, from about 1946 on, amphetamines quickly became integrated into all varieties of sport. Above, Pervitin, an amphetamine in use during World War II. British troops alone got 72 million amphetamine tablets during the war. According to one report, RAF pilots got so many it was said that Methedrine won the Battle of Britain.

John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone. Deciding that US athletes needed a chemical edge to remain competitive, Dr Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol), which appeared on the market in 1960.

At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson won the 100-m dash. But when a subsequent drug test found the steroid stanozolol in his urine, he was stripped of his gold medal; the world-record title went to American sprinter Carl Lewis, the runner-up. In 2003, however, it was revealed that Lewis was among those who had failed drug tests at the 1988 Olympic trialsâ€”he had tested positive for banned stimulants and bronchodilatorsâ€”and should have been disqualified.

Above, one of Doc Ziegler's star lifters, Ike Berger, shown here at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. At a body weight of 130 pounds, he was kilo for kilo the strongest man in the world. Anabolic steroid use was thought to be limited in the 1960 Olympic Games, but by the 1964 Games, the startling improvement in many strength athletes was impossible to ignore. Soon steroids were being extensively used by athletes in all strength sports. By the mid-1960s, most top-ranking shot-putters and discus, javelin, and hammer throwers were taking steroids.
John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone.

THG, it emerged, had been used by a number of high-profile sports stars. They included Major League Baseball players (Barry Bonds, Bobby Estalella, Jeremy Giambi, Amando Rios, and Benito Santiago); National Football League players (Chris Cooper, Bill Romanowski, Barrett Robbins, Dana Stubblefield, and Tyrone Wheatley, all of the Oakland Raiders); track and field athletes (hammer thrower John McEwen; shot putters CJ Hunter and Kevin Toth; and sprinters Zhanna Block, Dwain Chambers, Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery, Raymond J. Smith, and Kelli White; and middle-distance runner Regina Jacobs); boxer Shane Mosely; and cyclist Tammy Thomas.

John Bosley Ziegler, MD, a physician for the US weightlifting team in the 1950s and '60s, was having drinks with his Soviet counterpart in Vienna, Austria, in 1954 and learned that the success of the Soviet weightlifting team was due to their being given testosterone.

Deciding that US athletes needed a chemical edge to remain competitive, Dr Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an anabolic steroid, methandrostenolone (Dianabol), which appeared on the market in 1960.
