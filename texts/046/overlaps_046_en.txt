On the positive side, however, if you begin by believing with every fiber of your being that you will succeed, you'll tap lots of your potential, take massive action, and your belief in your ability to produce even better results in the future will be affirmed.

Handled effectively, they can be the most powerful forces for creating good in your life.
2. Follow the same procedure as in number 1, but choose the state of love. Remember a time when you felt totally loved or loving. Remember a specific time, and go back to that time, and discover HOW you go into the state of love, and notice the difference in pictures, internal dialogue and physiology between these two states. CHAPTER IV Man is what he believes. Think of the story of Pablo Casals at 90 - frail and arthritic, the veryl thought of playing the piano totally changed his state and thus the effectiveness of his body. He believed in the transcendent power of his art, his music. Beliefs deliver direct commands to your nervous system. Handled effectively, they can be the most powerful forces for creating good in your life. On the other hand, beliefs that limit your actions and thoughts can be as devastating as resourceful beliefs can be empowering.

In this case, success feeds on success and each success creates more belief and momentum to success on an even higher scale. Amazingly, sometimes just not having a limiting belief is enough to ensure success, or to have an experience that disproves a particular limitation - another reason we do the Firewalk. YOUR REALITY IS THE REALITY YOU CREATE THROUGH YOUR BELIEFS.
5) CREATE IN YOUR MIND THE EXPERIENCE YOU DESIRE IN THE FUTURE AS IF IT WERE HERE NOW - experiencing results in advance. It is important to remember that the potentials we tap, the results we get, are all part of a dynamic process that begins with belief, as seen by the following diagram: If you start with a belief system that stresses what you can't do, you tap a limited amount of your potential, and you take half-hearted action, tentative actions, which will probably lead to dismal results, and then what will these results do to your beliefs about subsequent endeavors?

A state can be defined as the sum of the millions of neurological processes happening within us, in other words, the sum total of our experience at any moment in time. The problem is, most of our states happen without any conscious direction on our part. People succeed or fail in life in direct relationship to their ability to consistently put themselves in states that support them in their achievements.

Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.
Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range. Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume.

Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume. Recommendations for strength/power exercise typically range from 1.6 to 2.0 g/kg/day, although some research suggests that protein requirements may actually decrease during training due to biological adaptations that improve net protein retention.

In addition to renal function, the relationship between dietary protein intake and bone metabolism has also served as the cause for some controversy. Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis.

Both the non-vegetarian and vegetarian groups possessed similar kidney function, and displayed the same rate of progressive deterioration in renal physiology with age. Preliminary clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested a benefit of relatively high protein diets on major risk factors for chronic kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Future studies are necessary to further examine the role of relatively high protein weight loss diets, dietary protein source (quality) and quantity on the prevalence and development of kidney disease in at risk patient populations]. While it appears that dietary protein intakes above the RDA are not deleterious for healthy, exercising individuals, those individuals with mild renal insufficiency need to closely monitor their protein intake as observational data from epidemiological studies provide evidence that dietary protein intake may be related to the progression of renal disease. In addition to renal function, the relationship between dietary protein intake and bone metabolism has also served as the cause for some controversy. Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis. This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load.

It is now known that the phosphate content of protein foods (and supplements fortified with calcium and phosphorous) negates this effect.
Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals.
Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals. Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained).

Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise.

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.

Both the non-vegetarian and vegetarian groups possessed similar kidney function, and displayed the same rate of progressive deterioration in renal physiology with age. Preliminary clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested a benefit of relatively high protein diets on major risk factors for chronic kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.
Another concern that is often cited is that high protein diets increase the excretion of calcium thereby increasing the risk for osteoporosis. Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals. One of the main points of debate relative to protein intake and kidney function is the belief that habitual protein consumption in excess of the RDA promotes chronic renal disease through increased glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration. The majority of scientific evidence cited by the authors was generated from animal models and patients with co-existing renal disease. As such, the extension of this relationship to healthy individuals with normal renal function is inappropriate.

Future studies are necessary to further examine the role of relatively high protein weight loss diets, dietary protein source (quality) and quantity on the prevalence and development of kidney disease in at risk patient populations].

Behavior is the result of the state we're in, and our states are created by 2 main components: 1) Internal representations a) what and how we picture in our mind b) what we hear and what we say to ourselves in our mind 2) Physiology - posture, biochemistry, breathing, muscular tension/relaxation.

Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals.
Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals. One of the main points of debate relative to protein intake and kidney function is the belief that habitual protein consumption in excess of the RDA promotes chronic renal disease through increased glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration.

Commercially, the two most popular types of proteins in supplemental form are whey and casein. Recent investigations have detailed the serum amino acid responses to ingesting different protein types. Using amino acid tracer methodology, it was demonstrated that whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids following ingestion, while the consumption of casein induces a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that was sustained over a 7-hr postprandial time period.

The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested. Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces.

The current recommended level of protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day) is estimated to be sufficient to meet the need of nearly all (97.5%) healthy men and women age 19 years and older. This amount of protein intake may be appropriate for non-exercising individuals, but it is likely not sufficient to offset the oxidation of protein/amino acids during exercise (approximately 1–5% of the total energy cost of exercise) nor is it sufficient to provide substrate for lean tissue accretion or for the repair of exercise induced muscle damage. Protein recommendations are based upon nitrogen balance assessment and amino acid tracer studies. The nitrogen balance technique involves quantifying the total amount of dietary protein that enters the body and the total amount of the nitrogen that is excreted. Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance.
Currently, the RDA for protein in healthy adults is 0.8 g/kg body weight per day. The purpose of this recommendation was to account for individual differences in protein metabolism, variations in the biological value of protein, and nitrogen losses in the urine and feces.

Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance. Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals.

The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested. Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces.

Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces. Consideration of the bioavailability of amino acids into the blood, as well as their delivery to the target tissue(s), is of greatest importance when planning a regimen of pre- and post-exercise protein ingestion.

The U. S. Dairy Export Council's Reference Manual for U. S. Whey and Lactose Products (2003) indicates that milk-derived whey protein isolate presents the highest PDCAAS out of all of the common protein sources due to its high content of essential and branched chain amino acids.

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day).
For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.

Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range. Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume.

(Note: the pictures may not be that important to you, or you may not be aware of them - you may have to go to step b.) b) What did you hear or say to yourself about this experience? - i. e. the other person's voice saying what, or what did you say to yourself - note both the words and the tonality of how those words were said. c) What did you feel in your body? - what sensations did you feel in your body when you were feeling the state of jealousy - like temperature, posture, breathing, muscular tension, feeling in the stomach, facial expressions, etc. Notice which of the three representations of internal system is the most powerful for you - which has the most power to put you in the state of jealousy.

Through the process of generalization, distortion, and deletion, the brain takes the sensory stimuli and represents or filters them into an INTERNAL REPRESENTATION. THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY. The key to directing your internal representations successfully is memory management. We must weed our garden by deciding what we are going to focus on - like W. Mitchell did. Life is like a river. It's moving, and you can be at the mercy of the river if you don't take deliberate conscious action to steer yourself in the direction you have predetermined.

In summary, it is the position of the International Society of Sport Nutrition that exercising individuals ingest protein ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day. Individuals engaging in endurance exercise should ingest levels at the lower end of this range, individuals engaging in intermittent activities should ingest levels in the middle of this range, and those engaging in strength/power exercise should ingest levels at the upper end of this range. Safety of protein intakes higher than RDA It is often erroneously reported by popular media that a chronically high protein intake is unhealthy and may result in unnecessary metabolic strain on the kidneys leading to impaired renal function. Another concern that is often cited is that high protein diets increase the excretion of calcium thereby increasing the risk for osteoporosis. Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals.

Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals. One of the main points of debate relative to protein intake and kidney function is the belief that habitual protein consumption in excess of the RDA promotes chronic renal disease through increased glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration.

This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load.

Recent investigations have detailed the serum amino acid responses to ingesting different protein types. Using amino acid tracer methodology, it was demonstrated that whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids following ingestion, while the consumption of casein induces a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that was sustained over a 7-hr postprandial time period.

The differences in the digestibility and absorption of these protein types may indicate that the ingestion of slow (casein) and fast (whey) proteins differentially mediate whole body protein metabolism due to their digestive properties.

In addition, data from stable calcium isotope studies is emerging, which suggests the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption. Also, given that exercise training supplies the stimulus for increasing skeletal muscle protein, levels in the range of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/d are recommended to transform this stimulus into additional contractile tissue, which is an important predictor in bone mass accrual during pre-pubertal growth.

Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual. For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range. Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume. Recommendations for strength/power exercise typically range from 1.6 to 2.0 g/kg/day, although some research suggests that protein requirements may actually decrease during training due to biological adaptations that improve net protein retention. Little research has been conducted on exercise activities that are intermittent in nature (e. g., soccer, basketball, mixed martial arts, etc.). In a review focusing on soccer players, a protein intake of 1.4–1.7 g/kg was recommended. Protein intakes within this range (1.4 to 1.7 g/kg/day) are recommended for those engaging in other types of intermittent sports.
Individuals engaging in endurance exercise should ingest levels at the lower end of this range, individuals engaging in intermittent activities should ingest levels in the middle of this range, and those engaging in strength/power exercise should ingest levels at the upper end of this range.

One of the main points of debate relative to protein intake and kidney function is the belief that habitual protein consumption in excess of the RDA promotes chronic renal disease through increased glomerular pressure and hyperfiltration. The majority of scientific evidence cited by the authors was generated from animal models and patients with co-existing renal disease. As such, the extension of this relationship to healthy individuals with normal renal function is inappropriate. In a well designed prospective cohort study, it was surmised that high protein intake was not associated with renal functional decline in women with normally operating kidneys. Also, it has been reported that there are no statistically significant differences in age, sex, weight, and kidney function between non-vegetarians and vegetarians (a group demonstrated to have lower dietary protein intakes). Both the non-vegetarian and vegetarian groups possessed similar kidney function, and displayed the same rate of progressive deterioration in renal physiology with age.
It is often erroneously reported by popular media that a chronically high protein intake is unhealthy and may result in unnecessary metabolic strain on the kidneys leading to impaired renal function. Another concern that is often cited is that high protein diets increase the excretion of calcium thereby increasing the risk for osteoporosis.

Both the non-vegetarian and vegetarian groups possessed similar kidney function, and displayed the same rate of progressive deterioration in renal physiology with age. Preliminary clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested a benefit of relatively high protein diets on major risk factors for chronic kidney disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.
It is therefore the position of the International Society of Sport Nutrition that active elderly individuals require protein intakes ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day, and that this level of intake is safe.

Protein intakes within this range (1.4 to 1.7 g/kg/day) are recommended for those engaging in other types of intermittent sports. In summary, it is the position of the International Society of Sport Nutrition that exercising individuals ingest protein ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day. Individuals engaging in endurance exercise should ingest levels at the lower end of this range, individuals engaging in intermittent activities should ingest levels in the middle of this range, and those engaging in strength/power exercise should ingest levels at the upper end of this range. Safety of protein intakes higher than RDA

Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals.

Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained).

Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise.

Recent investigations have detailed the serum amino acid responses to ingesting different protein types. Using amino acid tracer methodology, it was demonstrated that whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids following ingestion, while the consumption of casein induces a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that was sustained over a 7-hr postprandial time period.

Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance.
Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance. Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals.

Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals. Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained).

Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise.

Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual.

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day).

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.

Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume.

Recommendations for strength/power exercise typically range from 1.6 to 2.0 g/kg/day, although some research suggests that protein requirements may actually decrease during training due to biological adaptations that improve net protein retention.

While it appears that dietary protein intakes above the RDA are not deleterious for healthy, exercising individuals, those individuals with mild renal insufficiency need to closely monitor their protein intake as observational data from epidemiological studies provide evidence that dietary protein intake may be related to the progression of renal disease.

Other studies have shown similar differences in the peak plasma levels of amino acids following ingestion of whey and casein fractions (i. e., whey fractions peaking earlier than casein fractions).
Other studies have shown similar differences in the peak plasma levels of amino acids following ingestion of whey and casein fractions (i. e., whey fractions peaking earlier than casein fractions). Applied exercise science research has also demonstrated the differential effects that ingesting different proteins exerts on postprandial blood amino acid responses and muscle protein synthesis after exercise.

This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load.

In addition, data from stable calcium isotope studies is emerging, which suggests the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption.

Using amino acid tracer methodology, it was demonstrated that whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids following ingestion, while the consumption of casein induces a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that was sustained over a 7-hr postprandial time period.

In summary, it is the position of the International Society of Sport Nutrition that exercising individuals ingest protein ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day. Individuals engaging in endurance exercise should ingest levels at the lower end of this range, individuals engaging in intermittent activities should ingest levels in the middle of this range, and those engaging in strength/power exercise should ingest levels at the upper end of this range. Safety of protein intakes higher than RDA It is often erroneously reported by popular media that a chronically high protein intake is unhealthy and may result in unnecessary metabolic strain on the kidneys leading to impaired renal function.
Recommendations for strength/power exercise typically range from 1.6 to 2.0 g/kg/day, although some research suggests that protein requirements may actually decrease during training due to biological adaptations that improve net protein retention. Little research has been conducted on exercise activities that are intermittent in nature (e. g., soccer, basketball, mixed martial arts, etc.).

Another concern that is often cited is that high protein diets increase the excretion of calcium thereby increasing the risk for osteoporosis.

Both of these concerns are unfounded as there is no substantive evidence that protein intakes in the ranges suggested above will have adverse effects in healthy, exercising individuals.
Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual.
Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual. For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day).

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.

Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume.

Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis.
Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis. This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load.

This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load. However, studies reporting this effect were limited by small sample sizes, methodological errors, and the use of high doses of purified forms of protein.

Also, given that exercise training supplies the stimulus for increasing skeletal muscle protein, levels in the range of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/d are recommended to transform this stimulus into additional contractile tissue, which is an important predictor in bone mass accrual during pre-pubertal growth.

Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume.
Strength/power exercise is thought to increase protein requirements even more than endurance exercise, particularly during the initial stages of training and/or sharp increases in volume. Recommendations for strength/power exercise typically range from 1.6 to 2.0 g/kg/day, although some research suggests that protein requirements may actually decrease during training due to biological adaptations that improve net protein retention.

The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested.
The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested. Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces.

Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces. Consideration of the bioavailability of amino acids into the blood, as well as their delivery to the target tissue(s), is of greatest importance when planning a regimen of pre- and post-exercise protein ingestion.

A protein that provides an adequate circulating pool of amino acids before and after exercise is readily taken up by skeletal muscle to optimize nitrogen balance and muscle protein kinetics. The quality of a protein source has previously been determined by the somewhat outdated protein efficiency ratio (PER), and the more precise protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). The former method was used to evaluate the quality of a protein source by quantifying the amount of body mass maturing rats accrue when fed a test protein.
The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested.

The U. S. Dairy Export Council's Reference Manual for U. S. Whey and Lactose Products (2003) indicates that milk-derived whey protein isolate presents the highest PDCAAS out of all of the common protein sources due to its high content of essential and branched chain amino acids.

The current recommended level of protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day) is estimated to be sufficient to meet the need of nearly all (97.5%) healthy men and women age 19 years and older. This amount of protein intake may be appropriate for non-exercising individuals, but it is likely not sufficient to offset the oxidation of protein/amino acids during exercise (approximately 1–5% of the total energy cost of exercise) nor is it sufficient to provide substrate for lean tissue accretion or for the repair of exercise induced muscle damage.

Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained).

Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise.

The nitrogen balance technique involves quantifying the total amount of dietary protein that enters the body and the total amount of the nitrogen that is excreted. Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance. Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals. Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained). Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise. Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual.
The current recommended level of protein intake (0.8 g/kg/day) is estimated to be sufficient to meet the need of nearly all (97.5%) healthy men and women age 19 years and older. This amount of protein intake may be appropriate for non-exercising individuals, but it is likely not sufficient to offset the oxidation of protein/amino acids during exercise (approximately 1–5% of the total energy cost of exercise) nor is it sufficient to provide substrate for lean tissue accretion or for the repair of exercise induced muscle damage.

Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual. For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day).
The differences in the digestibility and absorption of these protein types may indicate that the ingestion of slow (casein) and fast (whey) proteins differentially mediate whole body protein metabolism due to their digestive properties.
The differences in the digestibility and absorption of these protein types may indicate that the ingestion of slow (casein) and fast (whey) proteins differentially mediate whole body protein metabolism due to their digestive properties. Other studies have shown similar differences in the peak plasma levels of amino acids following ingestion of whey and casein fractions (i. e., whey fractions peaking earlier than casein fractions).

One person may pay more attention to what (s)he saw, another to what (s)he heard - they look at it from different angles, and have different physiologies to begin the perception process with. Since we don't know how things really are, but only how we represent them to ourselves, why not represent them in a way that empowers ourselves and others, rather than creating limitations? The key to doing this successfully is memory management. In any experience, you have many things to focus on - no matter how terrible a situation is, you can represent it in a way that empowers you. We can represent things in a way that puts us in a positive state, or we can do the opposite.
The key word is representation - we experience our world through our five senses - visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory. Through the process of generalization, distortion, and deletion, the brain takes the sensory stimuli and represents or filters them into an INTERNAL REPRESENTATION.

The differences in the digestibility and absorption of these protein types may indicate that the ingestion of slow (casein) and fast (whey) proteins differentially mediate whole body protein metabolism due to their digestive properties.

This amount of protein intake may be appropriate for non-exercising individuals, but it is likely not sufficient to offset the oxidation of protein/amino acids during exercise (approximately 1–5% of the total energy cost of exercise) nor is it sufficient to provide substrate for lean tissue accretion or for the repair of exercise induced muscle damage.

Nitrogen balance studies may underestimate the amount of protein required for optimal function because these studies do not directly relate to exercise performance. Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals.

Also, it is possible that protein intake above those levels deemed necessary by nitrogen balance studies may improve exercise performance by enhancing energy utilization or stimulating increases in fat-free mass in exercising individuals. Indeed, an abundance of research indicates that those individuals who engage in physical activity/exercise require higher levels of protein intake than 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, regardless of the mode of exercise (i. e. endurance, resistance, etc. ) or training state (i. e. recreational, moderately or well- trained).

Also, there is a genuine risk in consuming insufficient amounts of protein, especially in the context of exercise; a negative nitrogen balance will likely be created, leading to increased catabolism and impaired recovery from exercise.

Relative to endurance exercise, recommended protein intakes range from of 1.0 g/kg to 1.6 g/kg per day depending on the intensity and duration of the endurance exercise, as well as the training status of the individual.

For example, an elite endurance athlete requires a greater level of protein intake approaching the higher end the aforementioned range (1.0 to 1.6 g/kg/day). Additionally, as endurance exercise increases in intensity and duration, there is an increased oxidation of branched- chain amino acids, which creates a demand within the body for protein intakes at the upper end of this range.

In addition, data from stable calcium isotope studies is emerging, which suggests the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption.

It is now known that the phosphate content of protein foods (and supplements fortified with calcium and phosphorous) negates this effect. In fact, some data suggest that elderly men and women (the segment of the population most susceptible to osteoporosis) should consume dietary protein above current recommendations (0.8 g/kg/day) to optimize bone mass. In addition, data from stable calcium isotope studies is emerging, which suggests the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption. Also, given that exercise training supplies the stimulus for increasing skeletal muscle protein, levels in the range of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/d are recommended to transform this stimulus into additional contractile tissue, which is an important predictor in bone mass accrual during pre-pubertal growth.

Overall, there is a lack of scientific evidence linking higher dietary protein intakes to adverse outcomes in healthy, exercising individuals.

Common sources of protein include milk, whey, casein, egg, and soy-based powders. Different protein sources and purification methods may affect the bioavailability of amino acids. The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested.

The amino acid bioavailability of a protein source is best conceptualized as the amount and variety of amino acids that are digested and absorbed into the bloodstream after a protein is ingested. Furthermore, amino acid bioavailability may also be reflected by the difference between the nitrogen content from a protein source that is ingested versus the nitrogen content that is subsequently present in the feces. Consideration of the bioavailability of amino acids into the blood, as well as their delivery to the target tissue(s), is of greatest importance when planning a regimen of pre- and post-exercise protein ingestion. A protein that provides an adequate circulating pool of amino acids before and after exercise is readily taken up by skeletal muscle to optimize nitrogen balance and muscle protein kinetics.

A protein that provides an adequate circulating pool of amino acids before and after exercise is readily taken up by skeletal muscle to optimize nitrogen balance and muscle protein kinetics. The quality of a protein source has previously been determined by the somewhat outdated protein efficiency ratio (PER), and the more precise protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS).

The former method was used to evaluate the quality of a protein source by quantifying the amount of body mass maturing rats accrue when fed a test protein.
Using amino acid tracer methodology, it was demonstrated that whey protein elicits a sharp, rapid increase of plasma amino acids following ingestion, while the consumption of casein induces a moderate, prolonged increase in plasma amino acids that was sustained over a 7-hr postprandial time period.

The differences in the digestibility and absorption of these protein types may indicate that the ingestion of slow (casein) and fast (whey) proteins differentially mediate whole body protein metabolism due to their digestive properties.

Other studies have shown similar differences in the peak plasma levels of amino acids following ingestion of whey and casein fractions (i. e., whey fractions peaking earlier than casein fractions).

While it appears that dietary protein intakes above the RDA are not deleterious for healthy, exercising individuals, those individuals with mild renal insufficiency need to closely monitor their protein intake as observational data from epidemiological studies provide evidence that dietary protein intake may be related to the progression of renal disease.

In addition to renal function, the relationship between dietary protein intake and bone metabolism has also served as the cause for some controversy.

Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis.

Specifically, there is concern that a high intake of dietary protein results in the leaching of calcium from bones, which may lead to osteopenia and predispose some individuals to osteoporosis. This supposition stems from early studies reporting an increase in urine acidity from increased dietary protein that appeared to be linked to drawing calcium from the bones to buffer the acid load.

In addition, data from stable calcium isotope studies is emerging, which suggests the main source of the increase in urinary calcium from a high-protein diet is intestinal (dietary) and not from bone resorption.

Also, given that exercise training supplies the stimulus for increasing skeletal muscle protein, levels in the range of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/d are recommended to transform this stimulus into additional contractile tissue, which is an important predictor in bone mass accrual during pre-pubertal growth.
