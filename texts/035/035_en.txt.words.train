sexsomnia is a (other) on (other) and a (other) condition (empty)
(other) with (other) he jumped out of the (other) (empty)
his room was on the third (other) (empty)
he was found later (other) (other) (empty)
what this (other) year old had just experienced was an out of body experience one of the most (other) (other) of consciousness (empty)
it was probably (other) by his epilepsy journal of (other) (other) and (other) vol (other) p (other) (empty)
he (other) (other) to (other) (other) says peter brugger the young (other) neuropsychologist at university hospital (other) in (other) (empty)
he jumped to find a (other) between body and self (empty)
he must have been (other) a (other) (empty)
in the 15 years since that (other) (other) brugger and others have come a long way towards understanding out of body experiences (empty)
they have (other) down the cause to (other) in a (other) brain (other) and are (other) working out how these lead to the (other) (other) experience of (other) your own body and (other) it from (other) (empty)
they are also using out of body experiences to (other) a long (other) (other) how we create and (other) a sense of self (empty)
(other) to great effect by such (other) as (other) (other) de (other) and (other) – some of whom (other) first hand (other) – out of body experiences are usually (other) with epilepsy (other) (other) brain (other) (other) use and even near (other) experiences (empty)
it is clear though that people with no (other) neurological disorders can have an out of body experience (empty)
by some (other) about (other) percent of healthy people have one at some point in their (other) (empty)
so what (other) is an out of body experience (empty)
a definition has (other) emerged that (other) a (other) of (other) bizarre (other) (empty)
the least severe of these is a doppelgänger experience your sense the (other) of or see a person you know to be yourself though you (other) (other) in your own body (empty)
this often (other) to (other) (other) where your sense of self (other) back and (other) between your real body and your doppelgänger (empty)
this was what (other) young patient experienced (empty)
finally your self (other) your body (other) and (other) it from outside often an (other) position such as the (other) (empty)
this split is the most striking feature of an out of body experience says (other) blanke a (other) at the (other) (other) (other) of (other) in (other) (empty)
surprisingly pleasant (empty)
some out of body experiences (other) just one of these (other) some all (other) in (other) (empty)
(other) many people who have one (other) it as a pleasant experience (empty)
so what could be going on in the brain to create such a seemingly (other) sensation (empty)
the first (other) (other) (other) in (other) when (other) team (other) across a way to induce a full (other) out of body experience (empty)
they were (other) (other) brain surgery on a (other) year old woman with severe epilepsy to (other) which part of her brain to (other) in order to (other) her (empty)
when they (other) a (other) near the back of the brain called the (other) (other) tpj the woman reported that she was floating above from her own body and (other) down on (other) (empty)
this (other) some kind of neurological sense (empty)
the tpj (other) visual and (other) (other) (other) and (other) information from the (other) (other) and the (other) sensations from (other) (other) and (other) that tell us where our body parts are in (other) to one another (empty)
its (other) is to (other) these together to create a feeling of embodiment a sense of where your body is and where it (other) and the (other) of the world begins (empty)
blanke and (other) (other) that out of body experiences (other) when for whatever (other) the tpj (other) to do this (other) (other) vol (other) p (other) (empty)
more evidence later emerged that a (other) tpj was at the heart of the out of body experience (empty)
in (other) for example (other) de (other) of university hospital (other) in (other) was trying to help a (other) year old man with (other) (other) (empty)
the feeling would (other) more than 15 (other) long enough to (other) out (other) (other) of his brain (empty)
(other) enough the team found that tpj was activated during the experiences (empty)
(other) from neurological disorders or brain surgery can only (other) you so (other) however not least because cases are rare (empty)
(other) scale studies are (other) and to (other) this blanke and others have (other) a technique called own body transformation tasks to force the brain to do things that is seemingly does during an out of body experience (empty)
in these experiments (other) are shown a (other) of (other) (other) of cartoon figures (other) a glove on one hand (empty)
some of the figures (other) the (other) others have their back (other) see (other) below (empty)
the task is to imagine yourself in the position of the cartoon (other) in order to work out with hand the glove is on (empty)
to do this you may have to mentally rotate you own body as one image (other) another (empty)
as volunteers (other) these tasks the (other) (other) their brain activity with an (other) and found that the tpj was activated when the volunteers (other) themselves in a position different from their (other) (other) – an out of body position (empty)
the team also (other) the tpj with (other) (other) (other) a (other) (other) technique that can (other) (other) parts of the brain (empty)
with a (other) tpj volunteers took (other) (other) to do the own body transformation task the journal of neuroscience vol 25 p (other) (empty)
other brain regions have been (other) (other) (other) (other) (other) to the tpj (empty)
the (other) (other) is that when these regions are working well we feel at one with our body (empty)
but (other) them and our sense of embodiment can (other) away (empty)
this does not however (other) the most striking feature of out of body experiences (empty)
it's a great (other) why people from their out of body (other) visualise not only their bodies but things around them such as other people says brugger (empty)
where does this information come from (empty)
one (other) of evidence (other) from the condition (other) as sleep paralysis in which healthy people find their body (other) as in sleep (other) being conscious see the (other) (other) (empty)
in a (other) of (other) (other) (other) people who had experienced sleep paralysis (other) cheyne of the university of (other) in (other) canada found that many reported sensations similar to out of body experiences (empty)
these (other) floating of of their body and (other) back to look at it (empty)
cheyne suggests that this might be the (other) of conflicts of information in the brain (empty)
during sleep paralysis it is (other) to enter a (other) like state in which you (other) of (other) or (other) (empty)
under these circumstances you are conscious of a sensation of movement yet your brain is (other) that your body cannot move (empty)
in an (other) to (other) this sensory conflict the brain (other) the sense of self (other) (other) vol (other) p (other) (empty)
it (other) by (other) the self from its body says cheyne (empty)
the self (other) to go with the movement and the body (other) left (other) (empty)
perhaps similar sensory conflicts cause (other) out of body experiences (empty)
brugger (other) has a suggestion for how someone might see things even though their eyes are (other) (other) on one of his patients who reported an out of body experience (empty)
(other) to this (other) father who was (other) by the (other) he had his eyes (other) (empty)
yet he later reported seeing from a perspective above his (other) his father going to the bathroom (other) with a wet towel and (other) his (other) (empty)
the patient (other) (other) his father (other) to the bathroom and run some water and must have felt the wet towel on his head (empty)
its not clear how the brain (other) that says (other) (other) (other) metzinger of the (other) (other) university in (other) (other) (empty)
metzinger does have a suggestion (empty)
imagine an (other) from a recent (other) (empty)
do you visualise it from a first person perspective or from a third person perspective with yourself in the (other) (empty)
surprisingly most of us do the (other) (empty)
in (other) visaul (other) the brain (other) (other) an (other) perspective says metzinger (empty)
we (other) know much about why and how but if something is (other) from such a (other) during an out of body experience there may be (other) for seeing (other) from the outside (empty)
whatever the mechanism the study of out of body experiences (other) to help (other) a (other) question in neuroscience and (other) how does self consciousness (other) (empty)
its (other) clear to us that we have a sense of self that (other) most of the time in our bodies (empty)
yet it is also clear from out of body experiences that the sense of self can seemingly (other) from your physical body (empty)
so how are the self and the body related (empty)
the (other) then (other) the volunteers back – which the volunteers see being done to their virtual self (empty)
this creates sensory conflict and many reported feeling their sense of self (other) out of their physical bodies and towards the virtual one science vol (other) p (other) (empty)
to metzinger these experiments (other) that self consciousness begins with the feeling of (other) a body but there is more to self – consciousness than the (other) (other) of (other) (empty)
(other) has many (other) says metzinger (empty)
we are trying to (other) them in building block by building block (empty)
this is just the (other) (empty)
in an own body transformation task cartoon figures are (other) (other) a (other) one at a time at (other) every (other) (empty)
volunteers are asked to (other) themselves in the position of the (other) to work out which hand the glove is on (empty)
the task (other) them to mentally rotate their body in (other) and causes (other) of brain activity similar to that of an out of body experience (empty)
(other) (other) is a (other) (other) for new scientist (empty)
look into my eyes hypnosis can (other) the (other) ways in which our (other) (other) says (other) (other) (empty)
i am about to have my left leg (other) my arm taken over by an alien force and quite (other) be made (other) (empty)
these (other) to my body will not be (other) with a (other) but (other) induced using hypnosis (empty)
the (other) if they occur will only be (other) my (other) david oakley (other) me (empty)
its all being done in the (other) of science (empty)
oakley is an emeritus professor at university college london (empty)
he is one of a (other) of researchers who (other) that by (other) hypnosis seriously they will help to (other) its (other) image see what's hypnosis (empty)
i think hypnosis is (other) and (other) says psychologist (other) (other) at the university of (other) uk (empty)
(other) because of (other) (other) (other) in books and movies which lead to (other) of hypnosis as a (other) and (other) (other) many pepole (other) (empty)
aside from (other) the (other) of hypnosis oakley also (other) to better understand some of the (other) neurological conditions out there (empty)
the idea is to use hypnosis to induce symptoms in (other) healthy people (empty)
this creates virtual patients with symptoms that can (other) be (other) on and (other) with a (other) of the (other) making it (other) to study the (other) brain activity that causes them (empty)
it's like (other) (other) says peter halligan a neuropsychologist at (other) university uk who (other) with oakley (empty)
it's only when things (other) down that you (other) the mechanism involved (empty)
these are all conditions that the researchers believe can be (other) in healthy people using hypnosis (empty)
many of them are (other) disorders in which people (other) physical symptoms in the (other) of an (other) physical cause (empty)
all are rare and when they occur it is often in (other) with other (other) such as (other) or (other) making them (other) to study (empty)
to get a sense of what these conditions are like and how it (other) to be hypnotised i have come with some (other) to university college (other) (other) (other) (empty)
i (other) to feel (other) or (other) or perhaps to (other) where i was but the (other) traffic is still (other) and i feel normal (empty)
then oakley suggests that my left leg is unable to move and my leg (other) to (other) with (other) and (other) (empty)
i am (other) by this but go with it (empty)
when he asks me to lift my leg i can do it but only slowly (other) and with (other) (empty)
this means the (other) has (other) (other) (other) probably (other) above (other) on the hypnotisability scale says oakley see how hypnotisable are you (empty)
had i been in the (other) percent of people who are highly hypnotisable i would have (other) to (other) the traffic and been unable to lift my leg at all (empty)
hypnotic elite (other) russell a (other) and (other) (other) of (other) is one of the hypnotic elite (empty)
russell (other) in one of (other) recent alien limb experiments (empty)
she (other) one experience as quite (other) (empty)
during hypnosis (other) arm was (other) in a (other) of ways first (other) (empty)
then the idea was (other) to her that an experimenter would enter the room who wanted her arm to move (empty)
when the experimenter (other) russell says she felt a bizarre sensation (empty)
i was being (other) (empty)
she wanted my hand to move so it (other) and i (other) involved in the movement at all she says (empty)
it was as if her thoughts were (other) my behaviour (other) (other) my thoughts (other) (empty)
can the activity in a hypnotised brain really (other) what's going on in someone with a real (other) (empty)
and if it can what can it (other) us (empty)
oakley and halligan are convinced their virtual patients are experiencing some of the same brain (other) as people with genuine disorders (empty)
halligan tells how they (other) induced a (other) of visual neglect in a volunteer by (other) that the left side of his visual field would (other) to (other) (empty)
they then asked (other) to copy a (other) with a (other) objects (other) on the page (empty)
most hypnotised pepole given this (other) would copy only the objects on the right hand side of the page as most people with visual neglect do (empty)
but this volunteer (other) the right hand side of every (other) on the page (empty)
same but different (empty)
however both (other) also saw some differences in brain activity between hypnotic paralysis and people with genuine cases of (other) paralysis (empty)
(other) – who saw greater differences than halligan – (other) this means that (other) interesting as a research (other) hypnosis is (other) to (other) (other) (other) (other) for people with real disorders (empty)
(other) their studies have lead them to some interesting (other) (empty)
these patients can run into (other) of the (other) (other) that are very (other) – (other) (other) (other) it's all in your head says (other) (other) of the (other) health (other) (other) in (other) canada (empty)
we say (other) it's all in your head because your brain is in your head (empty)
being able to show both (other) and patients that the conditions are being taken seriously is a (other) (other) (other) (empty)

in many cases these (other) are (other) (empty)
a better understanding of the (other) in the brain that have (other) away (other) help to (other) (other) (other) (empty)
if we understand how to (other) it says halligan (empty)
my wrist (other) (other) (empty)
he (other) suggests that when i open my eyes i will not be able to see (other) on in the left of my visaul field an (other) of visual neglect (empty)
i open them slowly (other) to see what this will be like but my (other) is normal (empty)
i feel (other) (other) but oakley tells me that even highly hypnotisable people only (other) experience this effect (empty)
the only (other) i (other) to have lost (other) is a (other) bit of time when oakley asks me how long i think i have been under i (other) about (other) (other) (empty)
he (other) when he tells me it was over an (other) (empty)
time (other) is a (other) side effect of hypnosis he says (empty)
(other) i (other) to experience full alien limb (other) or visual neglect my (other) on hypnosis has been (other) (empty)
i am more convinced of the power of the (other) after experiencing it for (other) (empty)
in some (other) this may be (other) but to (other) hypnosis (other) (other) its power much like (other) a (other) as just a (other) (other) (other) over the (other) that it can help someone get better (empty)
severe (other) patients some of whom are (other) (other) from pain even when given (other) have been made (other) through hypnosis says david oakley an emeritus professor at university college london (empty)
when (other) (other) a psychologist at the university of (other) in (other) (other) to the dentist for some (other) (other) work he (other) (other) in (other) of self hypnosis (empty)

since (other) the us (other) (other) of health in (other) (other) have (other) hypnosis an (other) (other) of pain relief and more recent (other) (other) have (other) its (other) in surgery (empty)
some studies have shown that hypnosis can have a greater pain relief effect than (other) (other) (empty)
(other) raz of (other) university in (other) canada has (other) another (other) effect which often (other) (other) who say hypnotised volunteers are just (other) it (empty)
