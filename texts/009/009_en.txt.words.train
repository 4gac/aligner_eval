how the human brain (other) to (other) and (other) (other) to see our world through echolocation (empty)
daniel kish has been blind since he was 13 months (other) but you (other) be able to tell (empty)
he (other) (other) (other) on his bike (other) out in the (other) (other) (other) and does other (other) many (other) (other) (other) for a blind (other) (empty)
how does he do it (empty)
kish is a human (other) a real life (other) (empty)
using a technique similar to what (other) and (other) use human echo (other) navigate using (other) cues given off by reflective (other) in the environment (empty)
(other) people know that this same technique can work for human (other) (empty)
but as a (other) of (other) echolocation comes (other) (other) to people like kish who are (other) of visual information (empty)
i don’t (other) learning this he says (empty)
(other) earliest (other) were of (other) things and (other) what they (other) have (other) (other) of and then (other) to (other) (empty)
kish was (other) with (other) (other) (other) (other) of the retina which is (other) of the eye responsible for (other) visual information (empty)
tumors form (other) in this (other) of cancer so (other) (other) is (other) to ensure they don’t (other) to the (other) of the (other) (empty)
(other) the tumors (other) be (other) from the retina (empty)
(other) (other) are (other) to (other) them off (other) by chemotherapy (empty)
the (other) is that the retina is (other) along with the cancer (other) (other) often are left (other) blind (empty)
kish (other) his first eye at (other) months and the other at 13 months (empty)
he has no memory of (other) (other) (empty)
his earliest (other) memory is from when he was very (other) (other) (other) he (other) out his (other) (other) and (other) (other) to a (other) (other) (other) in his (other) (empty)
after many (other) (other) to (other) his vision by (other) the tumors with (other) and chemotherapy his mother (other) the (other) (other) to (other) (other) (other) right eye and left retina (empty)
(other) by his (other) his mother (other) i see the building but do you see it (empty)
it (other) out ben had (other) up on the (other) in sounds (other) from (other) space (other) a (other) building (empty)
when ben was in school he (other) (other) with his (other) (empty)
at first it was an (other) (other) but then he (other) he could use the skill to detect the (other) (other) location and (other) of objects (empty)
(other) ben was (other) a (other) (other) playing video games walking to school and (other) (other) (other) else an (other) boy his (other) could do (empty)
he never used a (other) (other) a (other) cane or his (other) (empty)
very (other) ben (other) (other) in (other) after the cancer that (other) his eyes (other) (empty)
left daniel kish (other) the (other) on a (other) bike (other) (empty)
right ben (other) (other) in (other) (other) (other) with a (other) (empty)
(other) echolocation (empty)
for (other) researchers have been (other) to (other) out how blind people (other) for their (other) of vision (empty)
it was clear that some blind people (other) were able to hear objects that were (other) making no sounds (empty)
but no one (other) (other) how blind people (other) this (empty)
(other) and (other) often (other) about (other) or what it’s like to have an experience (empty)
(other) we (other) you a red (other) and (other) you about its (other) (other) you’re not (other) it (other) be (other) for you to answer red (empty)
he (other) really (other) whether his experience is like seeing (empty)
(other) he says he (other) has spatial imagery which has the (other) of depth and (other) (empty)
research (other) that the imagery of echolocation is (other) by the same (other) that (other) visual (other) in sighted people (empty)
the information (other) (other) (other) the (other) (other) — the (other) from the eyes to the brain — but it (other) up in the same (other) (empty)
and some individuals who have (other) blind (other) in life (other) the experience as visual in (other) of (other) (other) or (other) experiences (empty)
it (other) (other) that echolocators have visual imagery that is similar to that of sighted people (empty)
ben’s (other) (other) some evidence of this as he (other) (other) seeing the objects he could detect not just hearing them (empty)
and (other) (other) (other) are (other) (other) there is other evidence that ben really could see with his ears (empty)
ben had prosthetic eyes that (other) his real (other) but since his eye (other) were still (other) the (other) (other) in different (other) (other) like real eyes (empty)
in the documentary (other) people the boy who (other) without eyes it’s clear ben’s prosthetic eyes were making saccades in several (other) that (other) (other) (other) on different objects in the peripheral field (empty)
saccades are the (other) (other) movements of both eyes to a (other) (other) (empty)
the documentary never (other) ben’s saccadic eye movements but (other) no (other) they (other) and that they (other) the (other) stimuli he (other) (empty)
for example in one scene he was playing a video (other) that (other) (other) objects (other) the scene (empty)
although echolocation (other) give (other) the ability to see the images on a (other) screen ben could (other) games based on the sound (other) (other) through the (other) (other) (empty)
like many blind people ben used the sound cues to (other) out where objects were on the screen (empty)
his saccadic eye movements (other) to the changes in location of the (other) objects (empty)
the (other) (other) of saccadic eye movements is to (other) high resolution in vision (empty)
we can see with high resolution only when images from the visual field fall on the (other) (other) (other) (other) the fovea (empty)
when images fall on the more peripheral (other) of the retina we don’t see them very (other) (empty)
only a (other) (other) of an entire scene (other) on the fovea at (other) given (other) (empty)
but rapid eye movements can ensure that you (other) at many (other) of an entire scene in high resolution (empty)
although it’s not (other) (other) the brain (other) a (other) picture based on many (other) snapshots (empty)
many other (other) (other) eye movements (other) changes in and (other) about the environment and intended (other) (empty)
for example your eyes (other) in the (other) of a (other) (other) (empty)
even when (other) visual imagery and there is no (other) (other) or (other) environment to (other) saccadic eye movements still (other) (empty)
this (other) (other) when the brain stores information about the environment it stores information about eye movements along with it (empty)
when your brain (other) a visual image it’s (other) a (other) of different snapshots of (other) and rapid eye movements (other) keep the visual image organized and in focus (empty)
this (other) (other) (other) (other) ben’s saccadic eye movements the sound stimuli from ben’s environment (other) his brain to (other) spatial imagery (other) the sound stimuli and his saccadic eye movements (other) keep the image organized and in focus (empty)
seeing with your ears (empty)
sighted people often use a (other) form of echolocation (other) perhaps without even (other) it (empty)
when you’re (other) a picture on a wall one way to (other) a (other) (other) it is to (other) around and (other) for changes in (other) (empty)
but when you (other) on a hollow space in the wall you (other) don’t hear an (other) echo — (other) you can tell (other) that the space sounds hollow (empty)
research (other) we can (other) these (other) of stimuli (other) (empty)
when we do hear (other) it’s from sound (other) back off (other) objects (empty)
is sound (other) responsible for echolocators ability to navigate the environment (empty)
researchers (other) whether (other) cues such as the way (other) moves around objects can (other) information about the (other) (empty)
(other) (other) and (other) (other) from the (other) of (other) at (other) (other) to answer these questions in the (other) (empty)
their (other) (other) (other) both blind and blindfolded sighted participants to (other) (other) a board (other) at (other) (other) (empty)
participants were (other) for learning to detect the board by not walking (other) it (other) first (empty)
after (other) trials both the blindfolded and blind subjects (other) (other) able to detect the (other) (empty)
after about (other) trials blindfolded subjects were as (other) at (other) in (other) of the (other) as blind subjects when they were (other) hard (other) (other) (empty)
one (other) (other) that the blind and the sighted (other) (other) on (other) hearing (other) (empty)
teaching the blind to see (empty)
perhaps what is (other) (other) about echolocation is that it can be (other) (empty)
kish (other) his (other) (other) (other) (other) on the (other) (other) the first (other) approach to teaching the skill (empty)
(other) through his (other) world (other) for the blind he (other) to give the blind (other) the same (other) as sighted people by teaching blind people to navigate with their ears (empty)
so (other) don’t all blind people echolocate (empty)
the (other) says kish is that our (other) has (other) (other) training (other) (empty)
one example of this (other) is the (other) cane training (other) (empty)
the (other) (other) the cane (other) more (other) (other) (other) (other) for blind (other) people used to (other) in (other) (other) (empty)
(other) training (other) (other) from (other) by (other) an (other) approach intended to (other) environmental (other) (empty)
it’s a (other) (other) approach with very (other) (other) (other) (empty)
he (other) (other) to (other) their (other) environment for themselves and (other) (other) (other) from (other) (other) the (other) (other) could be (other) (empty)
kish then changes the cane his students use (other) walking (empty)
kish (other) a (other) stimulus by using a (other) panel he moves around in the (other) environment (empty)
students don’t (other) to know what (other) (other) for since the stimulus is (other) to be (other) (other) that it (other) the (other) (other) (empty)
but the panel (other) work for (other) at first (empty)
in (other) (other) he (other) a (other) (other) (other) or (other) else that (other) a very (other) sound (other) (empty)
(other) the brain is (other) on the (other) stimulus he (other) (other) its (other) to (other) the (other) (other) (empty)
the (other) (other) of (other) (other) students learn how to (other) what the objects (other) are (empty)
this (other) (other) (other) (other) where things are how (other) they are and depth of (other) which (other) to the (other) (other) of the object or (other) (empty)
students answer questions such as is the object (other) or (other) (empty)
is it highly (other) or (other) and is it highly reflective or (other) (empty)
the (other) is to (other) the changes in the sound when it comes back from when it (other) out (empty)
with (other) (other) students (other) learn how to (other) (other) (other) environmental stimuli (empty)
although the (other) instructors are (other) all blind echolocators kish (other) that sighted instructors could (other) the skill as well (empty)
several sighted instructors are in training (other) (other) of using echolocation themselves (empty)
his (other) is to have sighted instructors (other) just as well as blind echolocators (other) he (other) that although both sighted and blind individuals can echolocate they (other) have (other) different (other) experiences (empty)
in the (other) kish is hard at work teaching the blind how to use their ears to see (empty)
