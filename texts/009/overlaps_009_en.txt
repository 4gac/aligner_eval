After all, the visual cortex does process some sounds, particularly when the brain seeks to match auditory and visual sensory inputs. American psychologist Winthrop Niles Kellogg began his human-echolocation research program around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. His research showed that both blind and sighted subjects wearing blindfolds could learn to detect objects in the environment through sound, and a study by another researcher showed that, with some training, both blind and sighted individuals can precisely determine certain properties of objects, such as distance, size, shape, substance and relative motion from sound alone.

The reality is that the biomechanics do not sustain the kind of regimented movement you have to have in order for that to work â€” you lose fluidity of motion. You donâ€™t have to be a physical therapist to know thatâ€™s a recipe for a wrist problem. Then the real fun begins: The students learn to echolocate by systematic stimulus differentiation. Notice the term detection isnâ€™t included. No stimulus really occurs in a vacuum, so the process is not so much detection as it is distinguishing one stimulus from another and its background. The process follows a standard learning structure: Students first learn to differentiate among strong, obvious stimuli and then advance to weaker, less obvious stimuli.

His research showed that both blind and sighted subjects wearing blindfolds could learn to detect objects in the environment through sound, and a study by another researcher showed that, with some training, both blind and sighted individuals can precisely determine certain properties of objects, such as distance, size, shape, substance and relative motion from sound alone.

However, if we ask you to describe what itâ€™s like to see the color red, youâ€™d have a much harder time answering.
And although bat echolocation was documented in 1938, scientists didnâ€™t become seriously interested in the phenomenon until the early years of the Cold War, when military funding made the research feasible. It turns out human echolocation is akin to active sonar and the kind of echolocation used by dolphins and bats, but less fine-grained. While bats can locate objects as small as flies, human echolocators report that objects must be much larger â€” about the size of a water glass â€” for them to be locatable.

However, if we ask you to describe what itâ€™s like to see the color red, youâ€™d have a much harder time answering. By their very nature, questions about phenomenology can be nearly impossible to answer, making it hard to discover exactly what itâ€™s like to experience echolocation.

In the documentary Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Sees Without Eyes, itâ€™s clear Benâ€™s prosthetic eyes were making saccades in several situations that require focusing quickly on different objects in the peripheral field. Saccades are the quick, coordinated movements of both eyes to a focal point. The documentary never discussed Benâ€™s saccadic eye movements, but thereâ€™s no doubt they occurred and that they matched the auditory stimuli he received. For example, in one scene, he was playing a video game that required destroying objects entering the scene. Although echolocation didnâ€™t give him the ability to see the images on a flat screen, Ben could play games based on the sound effects played through the televisionâ€™s speakers.

Interestingly, when sighted individuals are deprived of visual sensory information for an extended period of time, they naturally start echolocating, possibly after only a few hours of being blindfolded. Whatâ€™s more, with their newfound echolocation skills comes some visual imagery. After a week of being blindfolded, the imagery becomes more vivid.

Once the brain is hooked on the characteristic stimulus, he starts manipulating its features to make the effect subtler. The next set of exercises helps students learn how to determine what the objects actually are. This essentially involves three characteristics: where things are, how large they are and depth of structure, which refers to the geometric nature of the object or surface.

Shocked by his statement, his mother responded, I see the building, but do you see it? It turned out Ben had picked up on the differences in sounds coming from empty space versus a tall building. When Ben was in school, he started clicking with his tongue.
Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating. Like Kish, Ben Underwood was a self-taught echolocator and was also diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastomas, in his case at the age of 2.

For example, in one scene, he was playing a video game that required destroying objects entering the scene. Although echolocation didnâ€™t give him the ability to see the images on a flat screen, Ben could play games based on the sound effects played through the televisionâ€™s speakers. Like many blind people, Ben used the sound cues to figure out where objects were on the screen. His saccadic eye movements corresponded to the changes in location of the virtual objects. The primary role of saccadic eye movements is to guarantee high resolution in vision. We can see with high resolution only when images from the visual field fall on the retinaâ€™s central region, called the fovea. When images fall on the more peripheral areas of the retina, we donâ€™t see them very clearly. Only a small fraction of an entire scene falls on the fovea at any given time. But rapid eye movements can ensure that you look at many parts of an entire scene in high resolution.

For example, your eyes move in the direction of a sudden noise. Even when recalling visual imagery and there is no sensory input or external environment to process, saccadic eye movements still occur. This happens because when the brain stores information about the environment, it stores information about eye movements along with it.

When your brain generates a visual image, itâ€™s likely a composite of different snapshots of reality, and rapid eye movements help keep the visual image organized and in focus.

His research showed that both blind and sighted subjects wearing blindfolds could learn to detect objects in the environment through sound, and a study by another researcher showed that, with some training, both blind and sighted individuals can precisely determine certain properties of objects, such as distance, size, shape, substance and relative motion from sound alone.

And some individuals who have gone blind later in life describe the experience as visual, in terms of flashes, shadows or bright experiences. It seems possible that echolocators have visual imagery that is similar to that of sighted people. Benâ€™s case provides some evidence of this, as he consistently reported seeing the objects he could detect, not just hearing them. And while self-reports are notoriously unreliable, there is other evidence that Ben really could see with his ears. Ben had prosthetic eyes that replaced his real ones, but since his eye muscles were still intact, the prosthesis moved in different directions, much like real eyes. In the documentary Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Sees Without Eyes, itâ€™s clear Benâ€™s prosthetic eyes were making saccades in several situations that require focusing quickly on different objects in the peripheral field. Saccades are the quick, coordinated movements of both eyes to a focal point.

And some individuals who have gone blind later in life describe the experience as visual, in terms of flashes, shadows or bright experiences. It seems possible that echolocators have visual imagery that is similar to that of sighted people. Benâ€™s case provides some evidence of this, as he consistently reported seeing the objects he could detect, not just hearing them.
Indeed, Kish says that, because he has been blind for as long as he can remember, he has nothing to compare his experience to. He canâ€™t really say whether his experience is like seeing. However, he says he definitely has spatial imagery, which has the properties of depth and dimension.

Ben had prosthetic eyes that replaced his real ones, but since his eye muscles were still intact, the prosthesis moved in different directions, much like real eyes.
Interestingly, when sighted individuals are deprived of visual sensory information for an extended period of time, they naturally start echolocating, possibly after only a few hours of being blindfolded.

If we show you a red ball and ask you about its color, assuming youâ€™re not colorblind, it should be easy for you to answer red. However, if we ask you to describe what itâ€™s like to see the color red, youâ€™d have a much harder time answering. By their very nature, questions about phenomenology can be nearly impossible to answer, making it hard to discover exactly what itâ€™s like to experience echolocation. Indeed, Kish says that, because he has been blind for as long as he can remember, he has nothing to compare his experience to. He canâ€™t really say whether his experience is like seeing. However, he says he definitely has spatial imagery, which has the properties of depth and dimension.
It turns out human echolocation is akin to active sonar and the kind of echolocation used by dolphins and bats, but less fine-grained.

Research indicates that the imagery of echolocation is constructed by the same neurology that processes visual data in sighted people.

This essentially involves three characteristics: where things are, how large they are and depth of structure, which refers to the geometric nature of the object or surface.

Shocked by his statement, his mother responded, I see the building, but do you see it? It turned out Ben had picked up on the differences in sounds coming from empty space versus a tall building.

After many failed attempts to save his vision by treating the tumors with radiation and chemotherapy, his mother made the difficult decision to remove her sonâ€™s right eye and left retina. This left Ben completely blind. A couple of years later, when Ben was in the back seat of the car with the window down, he suddenly said, Mom, do you see that tall building there? Shocked by his statement, his mother responded, I see the building, but do you see it? It turned out Ben had picked up on the differences in sounds coming from empty space versus a tall building.

One example of this restriction is the traditional cane training method. The military developed the cane techniques more than 60 years ago for blind veterans, people used to living in restricted circumstances. Kishâ€™s training curriculum differs from tradition by taking an immersive approach intended to activate environmental awareness. Itâ€™s a tough-love approach with very little hand-holding.

Once the brain is hooked on the characteristic stimulus, he starts manipulating its features to make the effect subtler. The next set of exercises helps students learn how to determine what the objects actually are. This essentially involves three characteristics: where things are, how large they are and depth of structure, which refers to the geometric nature of the object or surface.

So why donâ€™t all blind people echolocate? The problem, says Kish, is that our society has fostered restricting training regimens. One example of this restriction is the traditional cane training method. The military developed the cane techniques more than 60 years ago for blind veterans, people used to living in restricted circumstances.

When you click your tongue or whistle toward a nearby object, though, the echo returns so fast that it overlaps the original sounds, making it hard to hear an echo. But the brain unconsciously interprets the combination of the sound thrown in one direction and the returning sound as an alteration in pitch. What makes Ben and Kish so remarkable is that they can use what everyoneâ€™s brain unconsciously detects in an active way to navigate the world. And although Ben and Kish may seem superhuman because of their perceptual abilities, research confirms that sighted humans can acquire echolocation, too. After all, the visual cortex does process some sounds, particularly when the brain seeks to match auditory and visual sensory inputs. American psychologist Winthrop Niles Kellogg began his human-echolocation research program around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. His research showed that both blind and sighted subjects wearing blindfolds could learn to detect objects in the environment through sound, and a study by another researcher showed that, with some training, both blind and sighted individuals can precisely determine certain properties of objects, such as distance, size, shape, substance and relative motion from sound alone.

But when you tap on a hollow space in the wall, you usually donâ€™t hear an actual echo â€” yet you can tell somehow that the space sounds hollow. Research shows we can perceive these types of stimuli subconsciously. When we do hear echoes, itâ€™s from sound bouncing back off distant objects. When you click your tongue or whistle toward a nearby object, though, the echo returns so fast that it overlaps the original sounds, making it hard to hear an echo. But the brain unconsciously interprets the combination of the sound thrown in one direction and the returning sound as an alteration in pitch. What makes Ben and Kish so remarkable is that they can use what everyoneâ€™s brain unconsciously detects in an active way to navigate the world. And although Ben and Kish may seem superhuman because of their perceptual abilities, research confirms that sighted humans can acquire echolocation, too.

Kish wrote his developmental psychology masterâ€™s thesis on the subject, developing the first systematic approach to teaching the skill. Now, through his organization, World Access for the Blind, he strives to give the blind nearly the same freedom as sighted people by teaching blind people to navigate with their ears. So why donâ€™t all blind people echolocate? The problem, says Kish, is that our society has fostered restricting training regimens. One example of this restriction is the traditional cane training method. The military developed the cane techniques more than 60 years ago for blind veterans, people used to living in restricted circumstances.

Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating. Like Kish, Ben Underwood was a self-taught echolocator and was also diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastomas, in his case at the age of 2. After many failed attempts to save his vision by treating the tumors with radiation and chemotherapy, his mother made the difficult decision to remove her sonâ€™s right eye and left retina.

They move their heads in different directions when spatially mapping an environment, while sighted subjects donâ€™t move their heads when given the same types of tasks. Interestingly, when sighted individuals are deprived of visual sensory information for an extended period of time, they naturally start echolocating, possibly after only a few hours of being blindfolded.

Philip Worchel and Karl Dallenbach from the University of Texas at Austin sought to answer these questions in the 1940s.
They move their heads in different directions when spatially mapping an environment, while sighted subjects donâ€™t move their heads when given the same types of tasks. Interestingly, when sighted individuals are deprived of visual sensory information for an extended period of time, they naturally start echolocating, possibly after only a few hours of being blindfolded. Whatâ€™s more, with their newfound echolocation skills comes some visual imagery. After a week of being blindfolded, the imagery becomes more vivid. One of Kelloggâ€™s research participants said he experienced ornate buildings of whitish green marble and cartoon-like figures.

He has no memory of having eyesight. His earliest vivid memory is from when he was very young, maybe 2Â½. He climbed out his bedroom window and walked over to a chain-link fence in his backyard. Curious as to what they were, he climbed over the fence and spent much of his night investigating. Like Kish, Ben Underwood was a self-taught echolocator and was also diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastomas, in his case at the age of 2. After many failed attempts to save his vision by treating the tumors with radiation and chemotherapy, his mother made the difficult decision to remove her sonâ€™s right eye and left retina.

After about 30 trials, blindfolded subjects were as successful at stopping in front of the boards as blind subjects when they were wearing hard-soled shoes.
Whatâ€™s more, with their newfound echolocation skills comes some visual imagery. After a week of being blindfolded, the imagery becomes more vivid. One of Kelloggâ€™s research participants said he experienced ornate buildings of whitish green marble and cartoon-like figures. Is sound alone responsible for echolocatorsâ€™ ability to navigate the environment? Researchers wonder whether touch cues, such as the way air moves around objects, can offer information about the surroundings. Philip Worchel and Karl Dallenbach from the University of Texas at Austin sought to answer these questions in the 1940s. Their experiments involved asking both blind and blindfolded sighted participants to walk toward a board placed at varying distances. Participants were rewarded for learning to detect the board by not walking into it face-first. After multiple trials, both the blindfolded and blind subjects became better able to detect the obstacle. After about 30 trials, blindfolded subjects were as successful at stopping in front of the boards as blind subjects when they were wearing hard-soled shoes. But this ability disappeared when subjects performed the same experiments on carpet or while wearing socks, which muffled the sound their footsteps created.

When youâ€™re hanging a picture on a wall, one way to locate a stud within it is to knock around and listen for changes in pitch. But when you tap on a hollow space in the wall, you usually donâ€™t hear an actual echo â€” yet you can tell somehow that the space sounds hollow.

When you click your tongue or whistle toward a nearby object, though, the echo returns so fast that it overlaps the original sounds, making it hard to hear an echo. But the brain unconsciously interprets the combination of the sound thrown in one direction and the returning sound as an alteration in pitch.

While bats can locate objects as small as flies, human echolocators report that objects must be much larger â€” about the size of a water glass â€” for them to be locatable.

While sighted individuals show some ability to echolocate, Kellogg showed that blind echolocators seem to operate a bit differently when collecting sensory data.
While sighted individuals show some ability to echolocate, Kellogg showed that blind echolocators seem to operate a bit differently when collecting sensory data. They move their heads in different directions when spatially mapping an environment, while sighted subjects donâ€™t move their heads when given the same types of tasks.

They move their heads in different directions when spatially mapping an environment, while sighted subjects donâ€™t move their heads when given the same types of tasks. Interestingly, when sighted individuals are deprived of visual sensory information for an extended period of time, they naturally start echolocating, possibly after only a few hours of being blindfolded.
