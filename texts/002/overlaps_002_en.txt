It was only when Tana returned that I learned he was Milan Knazko, the actor who had led the revolution in Bratislava, who had addressed all the meetings in November 1989, who held the crowd in the power of his presence.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.

As I walked around Bratislava I realised that it did not match Prague as a capital city, which must be difficult for the new state: everyone from outside would immediately start comparing it to the Czech Republic.

Some of the old buildings were stately and dignified, but there seemed to be restoration and reconstruction going on in every street so that it was hard to look at the city as you walked around without seeing cement-mixers and lorries.

Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings.

I went into the new national gallery, and I tried to stop myself thinking of the national gallery in Prague up on the hill, the sheer grandeur of it, as against the modesty of this small building in a provincial capital on the Danube which had suddenly and unexpectedly become the capital city of a new state. Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings. It was out on its own as a piece of interventionist architecture.

Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them.

I walked up to the main square, which was different on an ordinary working evening: there were crowds of people waiting for trams, it was busier, the shops were all lit up, and the cafes on the upper side of the square nearest the cathedral seemed more elegant now that it was not drizzling. I spent a couple of hours wandering around the square as though it were a little city in itself. Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them. In one cafe, I watched as friends arrived at the neighbouring table and there was the ceremony of greeting and sitting down again and looking at the menu and talking to the waitress. A feeling that these people had money and had been doing this sort of thing all their lives. I watched from the plate-glass window of a cafe as the rush in the square slowed down and settled into silence for the evening. There were a lot of desolate-looking people hanging around the corridors of the railway station, the only place where you could keep warm in the city if you had no money.

Some of the old buildings were stately and dignified, but there seemed to be restoration and reconstruction going on in every street so that it was hard to look at the city as you walked around without seeing cement-mixers and lorries.

I went into the new national gallery, and I tried to stop myself thinking of the national gallery in Prague up on the hill, the sheer grandeur of it, as against the modesty of this small building in a provincial capital on the Danube which had suddenly and unexpectedly become the capital city of a new state.
At the first hints of twilight a couple came to collect their son who had been playing in the garden.
At the first hints of twilight a couple came to collect their son who had been playing in the garden. They were different from the rest, taller, much more glamorous, a bit older; even when they didn't talk - and the man said nothing most of the time, merely watched everything and smiled - they appeared to be the centre of things.

It was only when Tana returned that I learned he was Milan Knazko, the actor who had led the revolution in Bratislava, who had addressed all the meetings in November 1989, who held the crowd in the power of his presence.

Carnogursky was naive; he was just beginning. But I felt, all the same, that he needed to know, as other countries had learned in the years after the war, what the word Hitler meant to Jews, gypsies and homosexuals in Europe; and how the quisling states bear a guilt for what happened.

Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings.

At the time, Carnogursky believed, Slovakia had two options: to be divided between Poland, Hungary and Germany, or to become a puppet state under Hitler. The period is controversial, he added. I merely asked questions.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

The Slovaks are more conservative, seventy per cent of them are Catholic, they are more down to earth and not so ready to be influenced by ideology.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.

Everyone around him, he said, was anti-communist. He didn't think that anyone in Slovakia was pro-communist, although some people joined the party. But there was only one youth organisation, which was communist-run and he was a member; almost all young people were members. He lost three years of schooling because of the political activities of his father; he wasn't allowed into secondary school. He got a secondary education simply because his father had friends in the north of the country and he went to school there; the communists were not well-organised enough throughout the country to know who he was and prevent him.

It was only when Tana returned that I learned he was Milan Knazko, the actor who had led the revolution in Bratislava, who had addressed all the meetings in November 1989, who held the crowd in the power of his presence.

I noticed an open doorway with a light on and I peered in: there was a stairway to a cellar. I walked down. I could hear the drum thuds of rock music in the distance somewhere.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

A good number of former communists, he told me, quickly became nationalists. He himself wanted the relationship between the two states to be modelled on states of the European Union. I asked him about the war years. During the war, he said, Slovakia was formally independent for the first time. The Slovak state was quite successful, he said, economically, culturally, politically.

For Juraj, it was vital that a Slovak politician be present to apologise for what happened to the Jews in Slovakia during the war, and to make clear that the new Slovakia harboured no anti-Semitic feelings.

He just changed his point of view, he said, as if it all had really been very easy. He was in charge of new legislation, passing, for example, a law governing the freedom of the press.

He came over and said that this wasn't easy, but he thought he might be able to get me a senior figure who spoke English. One man, with whom he had worked, had moved away from him, he said. I told him that I had seen this happen. After a while we were ushered into a long office which was comfortably furnished. I felt that Juraj was excited being here and was looking forward to what the politician, who was called Jan Carnogursky, was going to say to a foreign journalist.

He got a secondary education simply because his father had friends in the north of the country and he went to school there; the communists were not well-organised enough throughout the country to know who he was and prevent him.

Along the way I could see the spiky spires of churches on the top of wooded hills. We passed small holdings with barns beside them in the shape of oversized abacuses for drying hay or wood. As we passed each station the station master would walk out on to the platform, perfectly dressed, and salute the train. In Zagreb I left my bags in the station and bought a ticket for the night train to Vienna.

I walked up to the main square, which was different on an ordinary working evening: there were crowds of people waiting for trams, it was busier, the shops were all lit up, and the cafes on the upper side of the square nearest the cathedral seemed more elegant now that it was not drizzling.

Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them.

He didn't think that anyone in Slovakia was pro-communist, although some people joined the party.
I felt that Juraj was excited being here and was looking forward to what the politician, who was called Jan Carnogursky, was going to say to a foreign journalist. Carnogursky was in his fifties. He was a thin man with a cautious and serious appearance. His parents were both teachers, he said, but his father had been a political activist before the war and had supported the Slovak state during the war. After the war he had tried to establish a Catholic party, and was imprisoned. Carnogursky was brought up as a Catholic. He went to Mass on Sunday. Everyone around him, he said, was anti-communist. He didn't think that anyone in Slovakia was pro-communist, although some people joined the party. But there was only one youth organisation, which was communist-run and he was a member; almost all young people were members.
I felt that they still saw themselves as having a role in the new Slovakia, and talking to me, telling me about events from the Slovak point of view, was part of this.

Juraj had a fancy car outside the apartment building, and I could see, as we sat in it to drive to his studio, that he enjoyed having a car like this.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

In the days after the revolution there was talk that the capital of the federation should be in Brno, which is halfway between Prague and Bratislava. But there was a real sense that the Czechs did not understand Slovak sensitivities. The idea, Juraj said, that there was no time for such matters now, that the establishment of a market economy must come first, was quite shocking for him. He had been sure that Havel would understand the problem, that it could not continue under democracy as it had under communism. After the revolution Juraj became a member of the Co-ordinating Committee of the Revolution, a twelve member body.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

I spent a couple of hours wandering around the square as though it were a little city in itself.

I watched from the plate-glass window of a cafe as the rush in the square slowed down and settled into silence for the evening. There were a lot of desolate-looking people hanging around the corridors of the railway station, the only place where you could keep warm in the city if you had no money. I watched as one of them, a man in his forties, strayed into the bar.
I spent a couple of hours wandering around the square as though it were a little city in itself. Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them.

Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings.

I walked up to the main square, which was different on an ordinary working evening: there were crowds of people waiting for trams, it was busier, the shops were all lit up, and the cafes on the upper side of the square nearest the cathedral seemed more elegant now that it was not drizzling.

In school, in the 1950s, the fascist period in Slovakia's history was completely ignored; instead, teachers concentrated on the uprising at the end of the war and the heroism of the communists.

He was good during the revolution, she said, brilant with the crowd, but he was not so interested in the systems and structures you have to apply when you are running a country.
I was not entirely sure that this scene and the scene at the grotto with the woman praying in the shadow of the tree were not from a dream, or a movie, or something imagined. But the cold was real.

I was ready to go home now, wandering around, killing time before my train was due to leave.
I was ready to go home now, wandering around, killing time before my train was due to leave. In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings.

I went into the new national gallery, and I tried to stop myself thinking of the national gallery in Prague up on the hill, the sheer grandeur of it, as against the modesty of this small building in a provincial capital on the Danube which had suddenly and unexpectedly become the capital city of a new state.

The main room of his apartment was one of those rooms that you catch a glimpse of in foreign cities: full of shadowy, lamp-lit spaces, walls painted white, paintings and a sense of people at ease in the evening.

Juraj had told me how much the city had been destroyed by a motorway cut through the old quarter. The new road had barely spared the cathedral, almost grazing it as it sped past. There was thus no great square in front of the cathedral, and there was no easy access to the old quarter or the Jewish quarter across the motorway.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

He was the one who used to shout 'Make a corridor' if someone was ill at the front of the crowd and needed to be carried to the back, until the phrase became a catch-cry.

For Juraj, it was vital that a Slovak politician be present to apologise for what happened to the Jews in Slovakia during the war, and to make clear that the new Slovakia harboured no anti-Semitic feelings.
In February 1990 he became acutely conscious that there were going to be serious difficulties between Havel and the Slovaks. Havel had organised a trip to Washington and other North American capitals. The delegation consisted of two hundred and ten people, the second biggest foreign delegation to Washington in history (the biggest was headed by de Gaulle).

In Zagreb I left my bags in the station and bought a ticket for the night train to Vienna.

I walked up to the main square, which was different on an ordinary working evening: there were crowds of people waiting for trams, it was busier, the shops were all lit up, and the cafes on the upper side of the square nearest the cathedral seemed more elegant now that it was not drizzling. I spent a couple of hours wandering around the square as though it were a little city in itself. Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them. In one cafe, I watched as friends arrived at the neighbouring table and there was the ceremony of greeting and sitting down again and looking at the menu and talking to the waitress. A feeling that these people had money and had been doing this sort of thing all their lives. I watched from the plate-glass window of a cafe as the rush in the square slowed down and settled into silence for the evening. There were a lot of desolate-looking people hanging around the corridors of the railway station, the only place where you could keep warm in the city if you had no money. I watched as one of them, a man in his forties, strayed into the bar.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

In the 1950s older people, retired people and workers who had bad jobs went to church, people who had nothing to lose. The regime, he told me, tried to influence the church, and priests collaborated with the regime while others did not. He himself did not make his first communion but others did; many went out to villages and did it secretly. In 1971 his own sister got married and had a wedding in a church in a small village. The Prague Spring was led by Dubcek, a Slovak who spoke Slovakian, unlike others who went to Prague and spoke only Czech. Later, he would get to know Dubcek and admire him for his sense of justice and his sense of humour. But the idea that he would travel one day to Washington with Dubcek was unimaginable in the dark years after the Prague Spring. It was always difficult being a Slovak in the federation, he said.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

Since Juraj's parents were not communists he could not get into art school in Czechoslovakia; instead, he got a place in Krakow. In 1975 he was invited by a family to visit the United States. It was always possible, he said, to get an exit visa, even though very few did. He loved New York.

It was nearly midnight and the streets were completely deserted. It was platonic Eastern Europe, where everything happened indoors, where nothing moved at night. The world had closed down.

The main room of his apartment was one of those rooms that you catch a glimpse of in foreign cities: full of shadowy, lamp-lit spaces, walls painted white, paintings and a sense of people at ease in the evening. Juraj 's wife, Tana, was in the room, wearing jeans and a loose top and no shoes. They both exuded physical wellbeing; there was not an ounce of spare flesh on either of them; they could have been Americans in an apartment in Manhattan. We had a drink and sat down. Juraj began to talk, moving back and forth over Slovakian history and recent political upheavals.

I wanted to know their views first on what had happened in Slovakia during the war.
It was platonic Eastern Europe, where everything happened indoors, where nothing moved at night.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

They both exuded physical wellbeing; there was not an ounce of spare flesh on either of them; they could have been Americans in an apartment in Manhattan. We had a drink and sat down. Juraj began to talk, moving back and forth over Slovakian history and recent political upheavals. Tana interrupted him often, making him explain things in more detail, or adding comments.

By this time he was studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bratislava, and, on his return he was expelled, told that he would have an imperialist influence on his fellow- students.
Juraj himself had good friends in Prague: they had a common problem - communism. There were only about seventy people killed during the Russian invasion, and in the immediate aftermath people were not sent to prison. Things were done slowly step by step.

It was a grotto, and there were a few candles lit in front of the statue of the Virgin, and a woman kneeling praying. There were trees all around offering shelter, and they rustled suddenly in a gust of wind. I saw a woman standing behind a tree, like a shadow, praying. There were plaques stuck to the stone in German, Hungarian and Slovak, with names and dates from the early years of the century, some of them - Tana translated for me thanking the Virgin for recovery from an illness. It was strange standing here, having been so close all afternoon without knowing that there was a grotto nearby. As we walked back up the steps to the road I could hear shouting in the distance, as though there was a football match going on.

Knazko was a popular film, TV and theatre actor, Tana told me, and after the revolution he moved to Prague to become an adviser to Havel.
Knazko was a popular film, TV and theatre actor, Tana told me, and after the revolution he moved to Prague to become an adviser to Havel. Once he grew disillusioned with Havel, he became a member of the Slovak parliament and Minister for Foreign Relations, but he had lost power in the many splits and personality clashes which had arisen since independence.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

They had, Juraj said, beautiful material of primitive Slovaks attacking the most loved politician in the world. Havel, he believed, must have known that they would get such footage.
On 14 March a demonstration was organised in Bratislava to commemorate the setting up of the Slovak state in 1939. Between two and three thousand people attended, which was tiny compared to the huge demonstrations which had taken place at the time of the revolution when more than a hundred thousand people would turn up. There were two thousand wild Slovaks, Juraj remembered, a mixture of fascists, communists, anti-Semites and nationalists. For them, Vaclav Havel was the real enemy. Juraj noticed that there was a surprising number of foreign journalists and camera crews covering this demonstration and then he understood. Without informing the Slovak minister for the interior, 'Citizen' Havel, as Juraj called him, had arrived in Slovakia and begun a walkabout during the demonstration. The demonstrators attacked Havel, spat on him, kicked him and shouted abuse at him and the TV crews filmed all of this.

He blamed Havel for coming to Bratislava that day.

On holidays in the mountains, a minister's wife wanted us to "respect her husband's office". No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

The Czechs are more eloquent, they have a stronger literary and artistic tradition, they are more secular, like Protestants, and they take ideology seriously.

The way the Czechs have been treating us, he said, seems OK only because we are Catholics, but if we were Muslims it would be quite different, there would be war.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.

But early in 1991 he began to change his mind. On 14 March a demonstration was organised in Bratislava to commemorate the setting up of the Slovak state in 1939. Between two and three thousand people attended, which was tiny compared to the huge demonstrations which had taken place at the time of the revolution when more than a hundred thousand people would turn up. There were two thousand wild Slovaks, Juraj remembered, a mixture of fascists, communists, anti-Semites and nationalists. For them, Vaclav Havel was the real enemy. Juraj noticed that there was a surprising number of foreign journalists and camera crews covering this demonstration and then he understood.

Some of the old buildings were stately and dignified, but there seemed to be restoration and reconstruction going on in every street so that it was hard to look at the city as you walked around without seeing cement-mixers and lorries.

I went into the new national gallery, and I tried to stop myself thinking of the national gallery in Prague up on the hill, the sheer grandeur of it, as against the modesty of this small building in a provincial capital on the Danube which had suddenly and unexpectedly become the capital city of a new state.

Close to my hotel was another gallery, which had obviously been restored inthe 196os: originally, there was an eighteenth-century building overlooking the river to which had been added a huge monstrosity like the sort of corridor which gets you from one terminal to another in an airport; this linked the upper storeys of the two wings.

Tana interrupted him often, making him explain things in more detail, or adding comments. I wanted to know their views first on what had happened in Slovakia during the war. I don't know why I believed that this was a good place to start. Slovakia was more or less on Hitler's side, Juraj said.

The Czechs were more rational and western; the Slovaks more emotional. In ways, he said, the difficulties between the two nations were caused by Czech lethargy in relation to Slovak grievances. He was not a Slovak nationalist; for him anti-communism was more important. Nationalism, he said, is always quite easy to misuse, as a means of mobilising people.

I was ready to go home now, wandering around, killing time before my train was due to leave. In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

We had beers and tried to talk despite the terrible, loud singing coming from the other tables. I was not entirely sure that this scene and the scene at the grotto with the woman praying in the shadow of the tree were not from a dream, or a movie, or something imagined. But the cold was real. And we went back to talking about politics. Knazko was a popular film, TV and theatre actor, Tana told me, and after the revolution he moved to Prague to become an adviser to Havel. Once he grew disillusioned with Havel, he became a member of the Slovak parliament and Minister for Foreign Relations, but he had lost power in the many splits and personality clashes which had arisen since independence. He was good during the revolution, she said, brilant with the crowd, but he was not so interested in the systems and structures you have to apply when you are running a country. I told her how amazed I had been by Carnogursky's response to the question about the war years and the quisling Slovak state.

The delegation consisted of two hundred and ten people, the second biggest foreign delegation to Washington in history (the biggest was headed by de Gaulle).

For Juraj, it was vital that a Slovak politician be present to apologise for what happened to the Jews in Slovakia during the war, and to make clear that the new Slovakia harboured no anti-Semitic feelings.

The opposite happened, since Knazko often disagreed with Havel and his team and strongly fought for Slovak interests. After several weeks in the Castle he lost direct access to the President and sometimes found himself waiting for days before Havel would agree to meet him.

There were ten million Czechs and five million Slovaks; the ruling class in Bratislava came to feel throughout 1990 that they were being treated as nice peasants who lived in the mountains, who did not know enough to be part of the great velvet future, whose education out of their fascism and their Catholicism would take a long time.

The idea, Juraj said, that there was no time for such matters now, that the establishment of a market economy must come first, was quite shocking for him.

Prague was not even aware that there was a festering Slovak problem, as there was no Slovak newspaper available in Prague and no Slovak politician close to Havel. Slovak emigrants in the United States pointed out that as far as the western media were concerned, Slovakia did not exist. In Prague, members of the old communist ruling class were slowly returning to positions of power, but in Bratislava, no one in the VPN (People Against Violence) had any political experience.

The opposite happened, since Knazko often disagreed with Havel and his team and strongly fought for Slovak interests.

It was the same problem as the Croatians had: how to deal with that period when Hitler offered them a quisling state and they accepted, how to deal with history that was still remembered by others such as Serbs and Jews as dark and murderous, but by Croats and Slovaks as the first time they had a state as well as a nation.

I walked up to the main square, which was different on an ordinary working evening: there were crowds of people waiting for trams, it was busier, the shops were all lit up, and the cafes on the upper side of the square nearest the cathedral seemed more elegant now that it was not drizzling.
The show of Slovenian strength was for the mainline only, it seemed. Along the way I could see the spiky spires of churches on the top of wooded hills. We passed small holdings with barns beside them in the shape of oversized abacuses for drying hay or wood.

Every now and then the general sense of ordinariness, the city at the end of the day, was disrupted by the appearance of soldiers in fatigues, big serious-looking fellows crossing the square, but no one else paid any attention to them.

The state of Czechoslovakia was created after the First World War, but since the Czech Republic was richer, Slovakia was always treated as its little brother to the east; there was tension between the two all the time.

In school, in the 1950s, the fascist period in Slovakia's history was completely ignored; instead, teachers concentrated on the uprising at the end of the war and the heroism of the communists.

The food was good, and the air was warm enough for us to sit out on the veranda, even though the sky was full of pale, low cloud. An American couple working as volunteers in a local bank told us how Prague was full of Americans now, Bratislava was a much better place to be if you want to mix in the society. At the first hints of twilight a couple came to collect their son who had been playing in the garden.

I felt that they still saw themselves as having a role in the new Slovakia, and talking to me, telling me about events from the Slovak point of view, was part of this.

A Croatian soldier moved slowly towards him, to the amusement of his colleagues, ceremoniously caught him by the shoulders and steered him back to the corridor. At the border between Croatia and Austria, a guard opened the door of my sleeping cabin and shone a torch in my face and asked me if l had any whisky or cigarettes. I told him I did not. The next guard wanted to see my passport. I fell asleep again and the next time I woke up the train was about to arrive in Vienna.

There were ten million Czechs and five million Slovaks; the ruling class in Bratislava came to feel throughout 1990 that they were being treated as nice peasants who lived in the mountains, who did not know enough to be part of the great velvet future, whose education out of their fascism and their Catholicism would take a long time.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

For Juraj, it was vital that a Slovak politician be present to apologise for what happened to the Jews in Slovakia during the war, and to make clear that the new Slovakia harboured no anti-Semitic feelings.

We drove back down to the city centre; he parked outside a modern building where the conference was going on. It was now lunchtime, so there should be people free, he said. As soon as we went into the main hall I could see why Juraj was not a member of the Christian Democrats. There were groups of men standing around; those who were not middle-aged looked as though they soon would be.

We had a beer. Juraj went to the phone and discovered that the KDH, the Christian Democratic Party, which had been in a coalition government after the 1990 elections but was now in opposition, was having its annual conference.

It might be difficult for him to go there, he said, making clear that the divisions and splits in the years since the fall of communism had caused a good deal of personal bitterness in Bratislava.

Juraj went to the phone and discovered that the KDH, the Christian Democratic Party, which had been in a coalition government after the 1990 elections but was now in opposition, was having its annual conference. It might be difficult for him to go there, he said, making clear that the divisions and splits in the years since the fall of communism had caused a good deal of personal bitterness in Bratislava. But he would take me there at lunchtime and see what happened. He and Tana discussed various characters who would be there, people they had worked with just a few years ago, and they laughed at what it would be like for Juraj to appear suddenly at the party conference.

When I visited him in Prague and tried to explain something which he wasn't prepared to accept as valid, he asked whether I realised I was talking to the Federal Minister of the Interior.

No one in the political mainstream in Slovakia had ever intended to secede from Czechoslovakia, he insisted, but when Havel announced, for example, that his country was not going to produce arms any more he did so without considering that Slovakia was where the arms were produced, and a sudden shut-down of arms factories would have a devastating effect on the economy there.

Even after separation, Juraj believed, the campaign against Slovakia was still going on; the idea was being put out that the Czechs were good, progressive, smart, intelligent and the Slovaks were unstable, anti-Semitic old-fashioned, pro-communist.

The way the Czechs have been treating us, he said, seems OK only because we are Catholics, but if we were Muslims it would be quite different, there would be war.

In Slovakia, he told me, there has never been the same urge for revenge for what happened under the communists, they were ready to forgive; the Czechs, on the other hand, wanted to go through the files and blame people.
