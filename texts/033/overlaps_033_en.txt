In 2012, he was stripped of his Tour de France titles since 1998. The next year, Armstrong admitted to doping in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey. Above, Floyd Landis, winner of the 2006 Tour de France, listens during the hearing at Pepperdine University in 2007 at which he was accused of doping.
A resulting investigation cast suspicion of systemic doping on many teams of the Tour de France; several withdrew from the race. American Floyd Landis initially won the 2006 Tour de France, but after his Stage 17 victory, his urine twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone and he was stripped of the win.

The internet allows us to send messages, share pictures, download music and stream videos at a touch of a button, but our online habits have a surprising impact on the environment. It’s probable you’ve already replied to a couple of emails today, sent some chat messages and maybe performed a quick internet search. As the day wears on you will doubtless spend even more time browsing online, uploading images, playing music and streaming video. Each of these activities you perform online comes with a small cost – a few grams of carbon dioxide are emitted due to the energy needed to run your devices and power the wireless networks you access. Less obvious, but perhaps even more energy intensive, are the data centres and vast servers needed to support the internet and store the content we access over it.

Also in 2015, a report commissioned by World Anti-Doping Agency indicated a deeply rooted culture of cheating at all levels in Russian sport. In March 2016, Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted to failing a drug test.

And it can be difficult for consumers to choose which data centres they want to use. Many of the major cloud providers, however, have pledged to cut their carbon emissions, so storing photos, documents and running services off their servers where possible is one approach to take. As an individual, simply upgrading our equipment less often is one way of cutting the carbon footprint of our digital technology. The greenhouse gases emitted while manufacturing and transporting these devices can make up a considerable portion of the lifetime emissions from a piece of electronics. One study at the University of Edinburgh found that extending the time you use a single computer and monitors from four to six years could avoid the equivalent of 190kg of carbon emissions. We can also alter the way we use our gadgets to cut our digital carbon footprints.
According to the United Nation’s International Telecommunications Union, however, this figure has flatlined in recent years despite rising internet traffic and workloads.

Another American, Lance Armstrong, was number one in the world in 1996, the same year he recovered from testicular cancer. In 2005, after winning his seventh Tour de France, he was accused of doping; that his teammates had been caught taking EPO gave weight to the accusations. In 2012, he was stripped of his Tour de France titles since 1998.

One study estimated that 10 years ago, the average Australian internet user was responsible for the equivalent of 81kg (179lbs) of carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted into the atmosphere. Improvements in energy efficiency, economies of scale and use of renewable energy will doubtless have reduced this, but it is clear that people in developed nations still account for the majority of the internet’s carbon footprint. (CO2 is a unit used to express the carbon footprint of all greenhouse gases together as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide).
And these emissions are predicted to double by 2025.

Anything we can do to reduce carbon emissions is important, no matter how small, and that includes how we behave on the internet, says Philippa Gaut, a teacher from Surrey, UK. She is one of a growing number of eco-conscious consumers trying to reduce their environmental impact online and on their phones. If everybody made changes, it would have more impact, she adds. One of the difficulties in working out the carbon footprint of our internet habits is that few people can agree on what they should and should not include. Should it include the emissions that come from manufacturing the computing hardware? And what about those from the staff and buildings of technology companies?

Above, former track star Marion Jones pauses while speaking to the waiting media at Federal Court after pleading guilty to lying to a federal agent about her drug use. She tested positive for THG and was stripped of five medals won at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Tour de France, the oldest and most prestigious race in cycling, has been riven by scandal since drug testing was introduced. In 1998, for example, a car full of performance- enhancing drugs belonging to the French Festina cycling team was found before the race. All nine Festina riders confessed to using erythropoietin (EPO, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production and is taken to increase stamina). A resulting investigation cast suspicion of systemic doping on many teams of the Tour de France; several withdrew from the race. American Floyd Landis initially won the 2006 Tour de France, but after his Stage 17 victory, his urine twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone and he was stripped of the win.

But things are not that simple – this figure can vary depending where in the world you are. Internet users in some parts of the globe will have a disproportionately large footprint. One study estimated that 10 years ago, the average Australian internet user was responsible for the equivalent of 81kg (179lbs) of carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted into the atmosphere. Improvements in energy efficiency, economies of scale and use of renewable energy will doubtless have reduced this, but it is clear that people in developed nations still account for the majority of the internet’s carbon footprint. (CO2 is a unit used to express the carbon footprint of all greenhouse gases together as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide). For some, the realisation that their online activity is harming the planet has spurred them into taking action.

She is one of a growing number of eco-conscious consumers trying to reduce their environmental impact online and on their phones. If everybody made changes, it would have more impact, she adds. One of the difficulties in working out the carbon footprint of our internet habits is that few people can agree on what they should and should not include.
But while changes in our personal online behaviour will only take us so far, there also needs to be change within the industry to ensure that carbon emissions can be reduced, says Elizabeth Jardim, a senior corporate campaigner at environmental campaign group Greenpeace.

The IT industry’s greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to reach 14% of global emissions by 2040 but at the same time the UN's International Telecommunication's Union has set the industry the target of reducing its emissions by 45% over the next decade.

She was suspended from competition for 2 years. On July 21, 2016, Russia's entire track and field team was banned by the IAAF from competing in the Rio Olympics for taking state-endorsed steroids.
By many accounts, drug use in elite athletes is not just common, it's pervasive. In a 2015 Cycling Independent Reform Commission report, one expert estimated that 90% of professional cyclists take performance-enhancing drugs. That same year, Kenya's Rita Jeptoo, a three-time Boston Marathon champion, was banned from competition for 2 years after testing positive for EPO.

By simply stopping unnecessary niceties such as thank you emails we could collectively save a lot of carbon emissions.
By simply stopping unnecessary niceties such as thank you emails we could collectively save a lot of carbon emissions. If every adult in the UK sent one less thank you email, it could save 16, 433 tonnes of carbon a year – the equivalent to taking 3, 334 diesel cars off the road, according to energy company, OVO.

While the IAAF has ruled that Russia's track and field team will be banned from Rio, many sports federations, among them gymnastics and tennis, have declared that Russian athletes should be allowed to compete. Above, the Russian flag. Dr Yesalis has testified before Congress multiple times on legislation related to the control of anabolic steroid and growth hormone abuse by athletes. What can we do about this? Not a damn thing, he concludes. It's not enough for them to watch the Olympics or any elite sporting event to see the very best. They want bigger-than-life people doing bigger-than-life things.

Using a phone over a mobile network is at least twice as energy intensive than using it over wi-fi, so if you can wait until you get home to watch YouTube that’s best, he adds.

On the whole, audio is less problematic, says Hazas, as streaming audio is less energy and carbon intensive than streaming images.

The carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet and the systems supporting them account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions, according to some estimates. It is similar to the amount produced by the airline industry globally, explains Mike Hazas, a researcher at Lancaster University. And these emissions are predicted to double by 2025. If we were to rather crudely divide the 1.7 billion tonnes (1.6 billion tons) of greenhouse gas emissions estimated to be produced in the manufacture and running of digital technologies between all internet users around the world, it means each of us is responsible for 414kg (912lbs) of carbon dioxide a year.
Each of these activities you perform online comes with a small cost – a few grams of carbon dioxide are emitted due to the energy needed to run your devices and power the wireless networks you access. Less obvious, but perhaps even more energy intensive, are the data centres and vast servers needed to support the internet and store the content we access over it.

And, one of the most enjoyable ways to be more environmentally friendly is to watch films and TV together. On the whole, audio is less problematic, says Hazas, as streaming audio is less energy and carbon intensive than streaming images. But researchers at the University of Oslo found that environmental impact of listening to music has never been higher, with a footprint of 200,000-350,000 tonnes of CO2 in the US alone for downloading tracks onto MP3 players. It’s thought emissions for streaming services may be even higher.
Fiddling with autoplay settings and switching from high definition to a lower resolution when it’s not necessary can also make a difference.

The aquarium’s Tropical Reef Habitat and Soft Coral Garden hold 367, 166 gallons of water, with an estimated 5.32 quadrillion viruses. If lined up side by side, those viruses would circle the Earth almost eight times. To count viruses in the Aquarium of the Pacific’s Tropical Reef Habitat and Soft Coral Garden, we enlisted Alexandra Rae Santora, a doctoral student working with Jed Fuhrman, a professor at the University of Southern California. She ran a sample through a 0.02-micron filter, which catches bacteria and viruses. She used a DNA-binding stain to make them visible under an epifluorescence microscope.

Hazas says the most efficient way to see your favourite programme is by waiting for it to be on terrestrial TV, or choosing to stream it over wi-fi rather than on a mobile network can also make a difference.
Hazas says the most efficient way to see your favourite programme is by waiting for it to be on terrestrial TV, or choosing to stream it over wi-fi rather than on a mobile network can also make a difference. Using a phone over a mobile network is at least twice as energy intensive than using it over wi-fi, so if you can wait until you get home to watch YouTube that’s best, he adds.

On the whole, audio is less problematic, says Hazas, as streaming audio is less energy and carbon intensive than streaming images. But researchers at the University of Oslo found that environmental impact of listening to music has never been higher, with a footprint of 200,000-350,000 tonnes of CO2 in the US alone for downloading tracks onto MP3 players. It’s thought emissions for streaming services may be even higher.
However, the number of times you listen to a piece of music can make a difference.
However, the number of times you listen to a piece of music can make a difference. Buying a physical CD or record can be better if you listen to the same album repeatedly, but if you only listen to a piece of music less than 27 times over your lifetime, then streaming can be better.

Researchers behind the study at the University of California found US gamers use 2.4% of their household electricity – 32 terawatt hours of energy every year – which is more than freezers or washing machines.

The carbon footprint of making a one-minute mobile phone call is a little higher than sending a text, according to Freitag, but making video calls over the internet is much higher.
If every adult in the UK sent one less thank you email, it could save 16, 433 tonnes of carbon a year – the equivalent to taking 3, 334 diesel cars off the road. Choosing to send an SMS text message is the perhaps the most environmentally-friendly alternative as a way of staying in touch because each text generates just 0.014g of CO2.

If we were to rather crudely divide the 1.7 billion tonnes (1.6 billion tons) of greenhouse gas emissions estimated to be produced in the manufacture and running of digital technologies between all internet users around the world, it means each of us is responsible for 414kg (912lbs) of carbon dioxide a year.

Improvements in energy efficiency, economies of scale and use of renewable energy will doubtless have reduced this, but it is clear that people in developed nations still account for the majority of the internet’s carbon footprint.

In March 2016, Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted to failing a drug test. She had been taking meldonium, which is used to treat ischemia but can also improve endurance.
In 2013, the same year that Lance Armstrong confessed all to Oprah, a scandal erupted when several Major League Baseball players were accused of obtaining human growth hormone from Biogenesis. Thirteen players received suspensions of 50 games or more, including Alex Rodriguez, Antonio Bastardo, Everth Cabrera, Francisco Cervelli, Nelson Cruz, Fautino de los Santos, Sergio Escalona, Fernando Martínez, Jesús Montero, Jordan Norberto, Jhonny Peralta, César Puello, and Jordany Valdespin—the most simultaneous suspensions in baseball history. Above, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez addresses the media in 2013 while facing suspension by Major League Baseball for his alleged use of steroids made by the Biogenesis clinic in Florida. By many accounts, drug use in elite athletes is not just common, it's pervasive. In a 2015 Cycling Independent Reform Commission report, one expert estimated that 90% of professional cyclists take performance-enhancing drugs.

This is largely because of improved energy efficiency and the move to centralise data centres into giant facilities. But while many companies claim to power their data centre’s using renewable energy, in some parts of the world they are still largely powered from the burning of fossil fuels. And it can be difficult for consumers to choose which data centres they want to use. Many of the major cloud providers, however, have pledged to cut their carbon emissions, so storing photos, documents and running services off their servers where possible is one approach to take. As an individual, simply upgrading our equipment less often is one way of cutting the carbon footprint of our digital technology. The greenhouse gases emitted while manufacturing and transporting these devices can make up a considerable portion of the lifetime emissions from a piece of electronics.

One study at the University of Edinburgh found that extending the time you use a single computer and monitors from four to six years could avoid the equivalent of 190kg of carbon emissions.

If we were to rather crudely divide the 1.7 billion tonnes (1.6 billion tons) of greenhouse gas emissions estimated to be produced in the manufacture and running of digital technologies between all internet users around the world, it means each of us is responsible for 414kg (912lbs) of carbon dioxide a year.

If we were to rather crudely divide the 1.7 billion tonnes (1.6 billion tons) of greenhouse gas emissions estimated to be produced in the manufacture and running of digital technologies between all internet users around the world, it means each of us is responsible for 414kg (912lbs) of carbon dioxide a year. But things are not that simple – this figure can vary depending where in the world you are. Internet users in some parts of the globe will have a disproportionately large footprint. One study estimated that 10 years ago, the average Australian internet user was responsible for the equivalent of 81kg (179lbs) of carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted into the atmosphere. Improvements in energy efficiency, economies of scale and use of renewable energy will doubtless have reduced this, but it is clear that people in developed nations still account for the majority of the internet’s carbon footprint. (CO2 is a unit used to express the carbon footprint of all greenhouse gases together as if they were all emitted as carbon dioxide).

It is similar to the amount produced by the airline industry globally, explains Mike Hazas, a researcher at Lancaster University. And these emissions are predicted to double by 2025. If we were to rather crudely divide the 1.7 billion tonnes (1.6 billion tons) of greenhouse gas emissions estimated to be produced in the manufacture and running of digital technologies between all internet users around the world, it means each of us is responsible for 414kg (912lbs) of carbon dioxide a year.

It’s thought emissions for streaming services may be even higher. However, the number of times you listen to a piece of music can make a difference. Buying a physical CD or record can be better if you listen to the same album repeatedly, but if you only listen to a piece of music less than 27 times over your lifetime, then streaming can be better.

The greenhouse gases emitted while manufacturing and transporting these devices can make up a considerable portion of the lifetime emissions from a piece of electronics. One study at the University of Edinburgh found that extending the time you use a single computer and monitors from four to six years could avoid the equivalent of 190kg of carbon emissions. We can also alter the way we use our gadgets to cut our digital carbon footprints. One of the easiest ways is to switch they way we send messages.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the footprint of an email also varies dramatically, from 0.3 g CO2 for a spam email to 4g (0.14oz) CO2 for a regular email and 50g (1.7oz) CO2 for one with a photo or hefty attachment, according to Mike Berners-Lee, a fellow at Lancaster University who researches carbon footprints.

The internet allows us to send messages, share pictures, download music and stream videos at a touch of a button, but our online habits have a surprising impact on the environment.

Rabih Bashroush, a researcher at the University of East London and lead scientist at the European Commission-funded Eureca project, calculated that five billion plays clocked up by just one music video – the hit 2017 song Despacito – consumed as much electricity as Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic put together in a single year. The total emissions for streaming that song could be over 250, 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, he says.

One of the easiest ways is to switch they way we send messages. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the footprint of an email also varies dramatically, from 0.3 g CO2 for a spam email to 4g (0.14oz) CO2 for a regular email and 50g (1.7oz) CO2 for one with a photo or hefty attachment, according to Mike Berners-Lee, a fellow at Lancaster University who researches carbon footprints.

You'd need to be a researcher at the National Institutes of Health to understand how he did it, says Dr Yesalis.
One strategy was simply running away and hiding when drug testers came calling. Professional cyclists must let their national antidoping agencies know of their whereabouts at all times, but as long as they accurately reported the cities they were in, they were not reprimanded for being unavailable. Armstrong often received advanced warning that he was to be tested and changed his travel plans or stayed in remote locales, which made tracking him down a challenge. He also used sophisticated techniques to thwart testers. In one, drug masking, an infusion of saline was used to return his blood values to normal levels.

We can also alter the way we use our gadgets to cut our digital carbon footprints. One of the easiest ways is to switch they way we send messages. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the footprint of an email also varies dramatically, from 0.3 g CO2 for a spam email to 4g (0.14oz) CO2 for a regular email and 50g (1.7oz) CO2 for one with a photo or hefty attachment, according to Mike Berners-Lee, a fellow at Lancaster University who researches carbon footprints.

(Read more about how to reduce the impact your flights have on the environment.) Those who have been tempted by cryptocurrencies might also want to think carefully about the environmental impact of the transactions they conduct. Vast amounts of computing power are needed for the so-called  proof of work  algorithm that is used to validate transactions on Blockchain's distributed ledger system. One recent study estimated that BitCoin alone is responsible for around 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year – greater than all the carbon footprint of the whole of Jordan.

They also showed that streaming games uses more energy, so gaming carbon emissions may worsen as more people adopt games where the computational work is being done remotely rather than on individual consoles, such as with devices like Google’s Stadia.

In 1998, for example, a car full of performance- enhancing drugs belonging to the French Festina cycling team was found before the race. All nine Festina riders confessed to using erythropoietin (EPO, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production and is taken to increase stamina). A resulting investigation cast suspicion of systemic doping on many teams of the Tour de France; several withdrew from the race. American Floyd Landis initially won the 2006 Tour de France, but after his Stage 17 victory, his urine twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone and he was stripped of the win. Another American, Lance Armstrong, was number one in the world in 1996, the same year he recovered from testicular cancer. In 2005, after winning his seventh Tour de France, he was accused of doping; that his teammates had been caught taking EPO gave weight to the accusations. In 2012, he was stripped of his Tour de France titles since 1998. The next year, Armstrong admitted to doping in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Some experts, however, insist that the energy needed to store and stream videos is less than more intensive computational activities performed by data centres. Some of the climate pollution that comes from internet use also comes from some rather dirty browsing. Pornography accounts for a third of video streaming traffic , generating as much carbon dioxide as Belgium in a year. On-demand video services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix account for another third while the final third of the video streaming carbon footprint includes watching YouTube and clips on social media.

Rabih Bashroush, a researcher at the University of East London and lead scientist at the European Commission-funded Eureca project, calculated that five billion plays clocked up by just one music video – the hit 2017 song Despacito – consumed as much electricity as Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic put together in a single year.

If every adult in the UK sent one less thank you email, it could save 16, 433 tonnes of carbon a year – the equivalent to taking 3, 334 diesel cars off the road. Choosing to send an SMS text message is the perhaps the most environmentally-friendly alternative as a way of staying in touch because each text generates just 0.014g of CO2. A tweet is estimated to have a footprint of 0.2g CO2 (although Twitter did not respond to requests to confirm this figure) while sending a message via a private messaging app such as WhatsApp or FacebookMessenger is estimated by Freitag to be only slightly less carbon intensive than sending an email. Again this can depend on what you are sending – gifs, emojis and images have a greater footprint than plain text. The carbon footprint of making a one-minute mobile phone call is a little higher than sending a text, according to Freitag, but making video calls over the internet is much higher.
Swapping email attachments for links to documents and not sending messages to multiple recipients are another easy way to reduce our digital carbon footprints, as well as unsubscribing from mailing lists we no longer read. I unsubscribed from automatically generated newsletters, as when I learned about the carbon footprint from emails, I was horrified, says Gaut.

The oceans alone may contain more viral particles than stars in the observable universe. Mammals may carry at least 320, 000 different species of viruses. When you add the viruses infecting nonmammalian animals, plants, terrestrial bacteria, and every other possible host, the total comes to … lots.
The SARS virus of 2003, the alarm that we now know signaled the modern pandemic era, gone. And of course the nefarious SARS-CoV-2 virus, cause of COVID-19 and so bewilderingly variable in its effects, so tricky, so dangerous, so very transmissible, is gone. Do you feel better? Don’t. This scenario is more equivocal than you think. The fact is, we live in a world of viruses — viruses that are unfathomably diverse, immeasurably abundant.

When you add the viruses infecting nonmammalian animals, plants, terrestrial bacteria, and every other possible host, the total comes to … lots. And beyond the big numbers are big consequences: Many of those viruses bring adaptive benefits, not harms, to life on Earth, including human life.
The Tour de France, the oldest and most prestigious race in cycling, has been riven by scandal since drug testing was introduced.
The Tour de France, the oldest and most prestigious race in cycling, has been riven by scandal since drug testing was introduced. In 1998, for example, a car full of performance- enhancing drugs belonging to the French Festina cycling team was found before the race.

For those who enjoy flicking through their social media, there is some good news. It is arguably the least carbon intensive form of digital entertainment. According to Facebook’s sustainability report, a user’s annual carbon footprint is 299g CO2, which is less than boiling the water for a pot of tea. But if you consider the platform has more than one billion users, that’s a lot of pots of tea. It’s possible to save carbon by disabling some features for social media and other apps.

The first attempt to map the energy use of gaming in the US found it produces 24 megatonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
The first attempt to map the energy use of gaming in the US found it produces 24 megatonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Researchers behind the study at the University of California found US gamers use 2.4% of their household electricity – 32 terawatt hours of energy every year – which is more than freezers or washing machines.

The greenhouse gases emitted while manufacturing and transporting these devices can make up a considerable portion of the lifetime emissions from a piece of electronics. One study at the University of Edinburgh found that extending the time you use a single computer and monitors from four to six years could avoid the equivalent of 190kg of carbon emissions.

The larger organisms are bacteria; the dots are viruses. With a counting grid, she determined the number of viruses in the field of view. Knowing the filter size and the volume of water allowed her to calculate the population per gallon. A virus is a parasite, yes, but sometimes that parasitism is more like symbiosis, mutual dependence that profits both visitor and host.

Everything depends: depends on the virus, on the situation, on your point of reference. They are the dark angels of evolution, terrific and terrible. That’s what makes them so interesting. To appreciate the multifariousness of viruses, you need to start with the basics of what they are and what they are not.

On the whole, audio is less problematic, says Hazas, as streaming audio is less energy and carbon intensive than streaming images.
The total emissions for streaming that song could be over 250, 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, he says. However, Hazas points out that some YouTube views are unintentional. A study led by his colleague Kelly Widdicks analysed streaming habits and found that some viewers use YouTube as background noise, and sometimes even fall asleep, generating carbon for no gain. Cutting back on these uses or stopping video from playing unintentionally on an open browser when you are not watching, could help keep your carbon footprint down. Fiddling with autoplay settings and switching from high definition to a lower resolution when it’s not necessary can also make a difference. Hazas says the most efficient way to see your favourite programme is by waiting for it to be on terrestrial TV, or choosing to stream it over wi-fi rather than on a mobile network can also make a difference.

But researchers at the University of Oslo found that environmental impact of listening to music has never been higher, with a footprint of 200,000-350,000 tonnes of CO2 in the US alone for downloading tracks onto MP3 players.

A bacterium is also a cell, with similar attributes, though much simpler.

And it can be difficult for consumers to choose which data centres they want to use. Many of the major cloud providers, however, have pledged to cut their carbon emissions, so storing photos, documents and running services off their servers where possible is one approach to take. As an individual, simply upgrading our equipment less often is one way of cutting the carbon footprint of our digital technology. The greenhouse gases emitted while manufacturing and transporting these devices can make up a considerable portion of the lifetime emissions from a piece of electronics.

To appreciate the multifariousness of viruses, you need to start with the basics of what they are and what they are not. It’s easier to say what they are not. They are not living cells. A cell, of the sort assembled in great number to make up your body or mine or the body of an octopus or a primrose, contains elaborate machinery for building proteins, packaging energy, and performing other specialized functions — depending on whether that cell happens to be a muscle cell or a xylem cell or a neuron.

Vast amounts of computing power are needed for the so-called  proof of work  algorithm that is used to validate transactions on Blockchain's distributed ledger system.
Vast amounts of computing power are needed for the so-called  proof of work  algorithm that is used to validate transactions on Blockchain's distributed ledger system. One recent study estimated that BitCoin alone is responsible for around 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year – greater than all the carbon footprint of the whole of Jordan.

One recent study estimated that BitCoin alone is responsible for around 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year – greater than all the carbon footprint of the whole of Jordan. Watching online videos accounts for the biggest chunk of the world's internet traffic – 60% – and generates 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, which is roughly 1% of global emissions, according to French think tank, The Shift Project.

Some experts, however, insist that the energy needed to store and stream videos is less than more intensive computational activities performed by data centres. Some of the climate pollution that comes from internet use also comes from some rather dirty browsing.
Vast amounts of computing power are needed for the so-called  proof of work  algorithm that is used to validate transactions on Blockchain's distributed ledger system. One recent study estimated that BitCoin alone is responsible for around 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year – greater than all the carbon footprint of the whole of Jordan.

Still other genes co-opted from viruses contribute to the growth of embryos, regulate immune systems, resist cancer — important effects only now beginning to be understood. Viruses, it turns out, have played crucial roles in triggering major evolutionary transitions. Eliminate all viruses, as in our thought experiment, and the immense biological diversity gracing our planet would collapse like a beautiful wooden house with every nail abruptly removed.

You'd need to be a researcher at the National Institutes of Health to understand how he did it, says Dr Yesalis. It was that sophisticated. Above, on January 14, 2013, Lance Armstrong speaks to Oprah Winfrey regarding the controversy surrounding his cycling career. Biogenesis of America, a health clinic specializing in weight loss and hormone replacement therapy, operated briefly in Coral Gables, Florida. In 2013, the same year that Lance Armstrong confessed all to Oprah, a scandal erupted when several Major League Baseball players were accused of obtaining human growth hormone from Biogenesis. Thirteen players received suspensions of 50 games or more, including Alex Rodriguez, Antonio Bastardo, Everth Cabrera, Francisco Cervelli, Nelson Cruz, Fautino de los Santos, Sergio Escalona, Fernando Martínez, Jesús Montero, Jordan Norberto, Jhonny Peralta, César Puello, and Jordany Valdespin—the most simultaneous suspensions in baseball history. Above, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez addresses the media in 2013 while facing suspension by Major League Baseball for his alleged use of steroids made by the Biogenesis clinic in Florida. By many accounts, drug use in elite athletes is not just common, it's pervasive.

Less obvious, but perhaps even more energy intensive, are the data centres and vast servers needed to support the internet and store the content we access over it. Although the energy needed for a single internet search or email is small, approximately 4.1 billion people, or 53.6 % of the global population, now use the internet. Those scraps of energy, and the associated greenhouse gases emitted with each online activity, can add up.
Why your internet habits are not as clean as you think. The internet allows us to send messages, share pictures, download music and stream videos at a touch of a button, but our online habits have a surprising impact on the environment. It’s probable you’ve already replied to a couple of emails today, sent some chat messages and maybe performed a quick internet search.

A virus is a parasite, yes, but sometimes that parasitism is more like symbiosis, mutual dependence that profits both visitor and host.
