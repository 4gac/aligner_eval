man of all (other) is (other) by the (other) of his (other) nature to (other) the (other) (other) to his (other) for (other) (empty)
his life is spent in (other) relations to the outside world (empty)
living – (other) (other) (other) – is a process (other) man"s (other) forces (other) (other) the (other) forces of the outside world (empty)
living becomes a (other) of (other) in man"s (other) toward a (other) (empty)
but there is (other) not only between man and his world but within man himself – between the instinctive (other) of the various powers of his (other) nature (empty)
(other) (other) (other) (other) life (other) be (other) man"s relations to his world and himself (other) like those in the (other) or animal order where relations are (other) and (other) by an instinctive functioning of the (other) nature (empty)

(other) (other) (other) and (other) himself as an animal as a man as an (other) as an (other) and as a (other) of (other) (empty)
his (other) nature will be understood as the (other) where instinctive impulses (other) (empty)
the impulses are (other) (other) to action they are the (other) of (other) (other) (empty)
all living is a process of solving problems as we (other) (other) of them (empty)
(other) solving is the (other) of (other) activity and is essential to all (other) of life – work (other) and art (empty)
(other) work of art (other) with a (other) and grows through (other) (empty)
in dance as in every art it is essential to (other) the mind to (other) some (other) as an instrument with which to (other) a medium into an art form (empty)
in dance the body is (other) as the instrument and movement as the medium (empty)
(other) a (other) has (other) (other) to (other) in (other) (empty)
every (other) (other) takes its (other) (other) (empty)
(other) it is (other) by (other) or it (other) with past impressions and forms a definite feeling or (other) (empty)
(other) of mind (other) be said to be the (other) of (other) of the (other) and (other) (other) which (other) upon the (other) of a stimulus (empty)
therefore (other) that have not (other) (other) (other) will (other) (other) or nothing toward (other) (empty)

the process (other) man (other) (other) himself experience and (other) (other) (other) (other) (other) and (other) is (other) through the nervous system by (other) of its stimulus response mechanism (empty)
to (other) these (other) (other) it (other) (other) (other) (empty)
first of all there are those (other) organs or receiving organs receptors that (other) up (other) (other) the outside world (empty)
they are (other) (other) (other) (other) to (other) various forms of (other) stimuli and to (other) them to the brain in the form of (other) impulses (empty)
(other) of them we are (other) to (other) in on all (other) activities (other) (other) (empty)
these receptors are the only (other) through which the forces of the world outside or the (other) forces within the body can (other) the (other) nervous system and (other) it into activity (empty)
they are the only way (other) forces can attain awareness (empty)
(other) as the receptors are specialized agents receiving stimuli the (other) are specialized (other) agents (empty)
between these (other) a (other) (other) (other) an (other) (other) as well as (other) impulses in and (other) (empty)
it also (other) (other) (other) for (other) action (empty)
before an (other) motor response is (other) the great (other) of incoming (other) (other) a profound change (empty)
it becomes (other) into definite (other) (other) or (other) of the (other) upon which (other) is (other) (empty)
this change takes place in the cerebral cortex where residues of past impressions are (other) and where (other) correlations and associations of great complexity take place (empty)
there (other) (other) (other) (other) in (other) as well as in action (empty)
as the incoming impulses (other) toward the (other) and (other) (other) of cortex they are first (other) at a subcortical (other) (other) the thalamus (empty)
the reflex activity of the thalamus does not attain (other) consciousness but (other) it (other) a feeling tone to the awareness (other) (other) (empty)
the thalamus is (other) (other) of as the old brain (empty)
it (other) that within this old brain (other) the (other) up (other) of the (other) – residues of (other) experience that have (other) man to (other) and that are therefore (other) in emotional tone (empty)
(other) the (other) (other) of sensations and the emotional life in (other) are believed to reside in this old brain and not in the cerebral cortex (empty)
the sensations (other) are without (other) (other) and (other) (empty)
these (other) the (other) (other) of the cortex (empty)
the thalamus and the (other) (other) take (other) of all impulses of the instinctive (other) without (other) to the cortex but they are not (other) of its (other) influence (empty)
(other) subcortical (other) that has profound influence upon all movement is the cerebellum (empty)
it does not (other) movement but in some way it (other) the tonicity of the muscles and (other) the (other) of the (other) muscles (empty)
it (other) (other) (other) of (other) (other) (empty)
the (other) of its (other) activity (other) (other) are not (other) understood (empty)
but it is (other) that the cerebellum is the mechanism of (other) motor (other) and is (other) (other) to reflex and instinctive activities (empty)
(other) (other) has (other) that (other) of tonicity (other) to the (other) functioning of the cerebellum (other) in (other) (other) of the (other) (empty)
(other) and consciousness the (other) are believed to reside within the (other) (other) of the (other) (empty)
correlations and associations of great complexity take place within it (empty)
it also (other) the (other) to (other) past impressions (empty)
it is so (other) that every (other) not only (other) incoming impulses but (other) (other) impulses as well (empty)
