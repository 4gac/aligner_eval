Intelligence and consciousness (the psyche) are believed to reside within the gray matter of the cerebrum. Correlations and associations of great complexity take place within it.
Another subcortical area that has profound influence upon all movement is the cerebellum. It does not initiate movement, but in some way it affects the tonicity of the muscles and diminishes the tonus of the antagonist muscles. It maintains proper balance of muscular contractions. The details of its functional activity, although appreciated, are not clearly understood.

Between these lies a conducting tissue, serving an associative function as well as carrying impulses in and out. It also provides infinite possibilities for correlative action. With such an arrangement for association and overlapping of impulses, we can at once appreciate how infinite and vast are the possibilities of the mind, and can theorize that there are perceptual areas of the brain awaiting further sensitization to forms of energy pervading the ether, of which, as yet, man remains unaware. Before an effective motor response is made, the great mass of incoming material undergoes a profound change. It becomes organized into definite ideas about, or images of, the environment upon which energy is expended. This change takes place in the cerebral cortex, where residues of past impressions are retained and where selective correlations and associations of great complexity take place. There emerge new behaviour patterns in thought as well as in action. As the incoming impulses course toward the discriminating and organizing centers of cortex, they are first delayed at a subcortical relay station, the thalamus.

The reactions of one mind will be different from those of a mind that has differently organized impressions. Every sensed impression takes its particular direction.

The sparks dance purple in her hands, lightning like veins through her arms. You can’t fix this. It was never yours to control. But my hands fumble over the touch screen, thumbs sliding wet over her face on the contact screen. She’s programmed in the same stupid anime ringtone I have on my phone, and it jingles inanely, all synthetic voices and pre-ordained sound. I wait, mouth dry, my body shaking like the sky above the Mojave before it rains. Painted in brilliant, feverish strokes in my head, the daisy chain grows. CIVILIZATION is the state of man.

It does not initiate movement, but in some way it affects the tonicity of the muscles and diminishes the tonus of the antagonist muscles.
Impulses that involve association, selection, and discrimination are referred to the cortex for these processes before being passed on to the effectors for execution.

Power of mind may be said to be the degree of strength of the stimulative and regulative processes which follow upon the perception of a stimulus. Therefore, experiences that have not been sufficiently perceived will contribute little or nothing toward expression. What has not impresses cannot be expressed. A properly functioning mind is constantly receiving impressions, associating them, refining them, selecting and releasing them, and do transforming them that they may better serve its purpose.

To achieve these integrated responses it employs special tools. First of all there are those sense organs, or receiving organs (receptors), that pick up information from the outside world. They are terminal sensory structures adapted to receive various forms of environmental stimuli and to transmit them to the brain in the form of nerve impulses.

The group of sense organs that are of special interest in the study of movement are those in the muscles, joints, and tendons. They are stimulated by the activity of these parts, reporting to the mind the exact state of muscular contraction, the range of joint movement.

They are stimulated by the activity of these parts, reporting to the mind the exact state of muscular contraction, the range of joint movement. It is by means of this movement sense – the kinaesthetic sense – that we can judge, the timing, force, and extent of our movement, and adjust ourselves consciously or automatically to this information.

The receptors, then, bring, as grist to the mill, a great mass of sensory material. The task of executing a reaction to this sensory material belongs to the effectors, which are the organs of response. Just as the receptors are specialized agents receiving stimuli, the effectors are specialized discharging agents.
The group of sense organs that are of special interest in the study of movement are those in the muscles, joints, and tendons. They are stimulated by the activity of these parts, reporting to the mind the exact state of muscular contraction, the range of joint movement.

But it is certain that the cerebellum is the mechanism of unconscious motor coordination and is devoted chiefly to reflex and instinctive activities.
The sensations, however, are without clear localization and discrimination. These need the co-operation of the cortex. The thalamus and the spinal cord take care of all impulses of the instinctive type without reference to the cortex, but they are not free of its inhibiting influence. Another subcortical area that has profound influence upon all movement is the cerebellum. It does not initiate movement, but in some way it affects the tonicity of the muscles and diminishes the tonus of the antagonist muscles. It maintains proper balance of muscular contractions. The details of its functional activity, although appreciated, are not clearly understood. But it is certain that the cerebellum is the mechanism of unconscious motor coordination and is devoted chiefly to reflex and instinctive activities. Medical science has discovered that loss of tonicity, due to the impaired functioning of the cerebellum, results in increases mobility of the joints.

The reactions of one mind will be different from those of a mind that has differently organized impressions. Every sensed impression takes its particular direction. Either it is arrested by counterimpressions, or it blends with past impressions and forms a definite feeling or attitude. Power of mind may be said to be the degree of strength of the stimulative and regulative processes which follow upon the perception of a stimulus. Therefore, experiences that have not been sufficiently perceived will contribute little or nothing toward expression. What has not impresses cannot be expressed.

The group of sense organs that are of special interest in the study of movement are those in the muscles, joints, and tendons. They are stimulated by the activity of these parts, reporting to the mind the exact state of muscular contraction, the range of joint movement. It is by means of this movement sense – the kinaesthetic sense – that we can judge, the timing, force, and extent of our movement, and adjust ourselves consciously or automatically to this information. To this group of receptors also belong the organs of static and equilibratory sensations, which serve to maintain body balance and posture.
These receptors are the only media through which the forces of the world outside or the generating forces within the body can reach the central nervous system and bring it into activity. They are the only way such forces can attain awareness.

This inner force, or motive power that drives us on in the life of our choosing, resides in that complex center which perceives, thinks, reasons, comprehends, remembers, imagines, and creates – the center we call mind. Contemporary education regards the individual as a growing, changing organism whose mind becomes increasingly his most distinctive and dominant characteristic. The word mind is an abstract term.
Whatever thought and feeling tones are to be expresses must be felt through the body.

With such an arrangement for association and overlapping of impulses, we can at once appreciate how infinite and vast are the possibilities of the mind, and can theorize that there are perceptual areas of the brain awaiting further sensitization to forms of energy pervading the ether, of which, as yet, man remains unaware.
