So that was, as they say, permission. As an undergraduate at Queen’s University, of course I had been lectured on contemporary poetry, and I had read Eliot, I had read Auden.
And I think it was right to be shy of it, because nobody knows quite what it is. I’m still not sure.

Wachtel: When you were writing as an undergraduate, you went under the name of Incertus or Uncertain, and then when you got this kind of affirmation to trust your own experience of rural life through, as you say, Ted Hughes or Patrick Kavanagh or even Robert Frost, it gave you this permission.

And I think maybe that’s just a common experience; that you are next in line, there’s nothing over your head in terms of age, in terms of a parent. It coincided in my own life with a wonderful bout of writing a couple of years later—1988, 1989—a sequence of poems eventually called Squarings.

And I think nowadays a lot of people really experience that in front of a screen. A computer screen is an entrancement device. It’s kind of hypnotic, that grey glow. Not that I would begin poems on the screen.

Wachtel: You were part of a literary world in Northern Ireland for a while; there was a certain poetry scene in the 1960s and 1970s.

When I came back to Belfast, I was first of all fortified in the knowledge that I could go back to the English department, because the last thing the chairman said to me was, "If you ever need to come back, you’d be very welcome. ”There was that security blanket, and then there was a feeling of vocation that had grown in me during that year. I taught for another year in Queen’s University and finished my third book, and I got a feeling that it was time to declare myself as a writer. So I thought, okay, go for it. But there was no immediate plan at all that we would go to the Republic of Ireland. That early summer of 1972, Marie and I were driving around the north—County Derry, County Tyrone, County Antrim—looking at places. Then from Canada, we got a letter from our dear friend Ann Saddlemyer, who was then teaching in the University of Toronto at Massey College. She had this cottage in County Wicklow in the Republic, south of Dublin.
And there was something in myself that relished the frugality of life in the cottage, something that belonged in my first life, but it wasn’t a matter of fleeing the north.

Wachtel: There are references to the Troubles in some of your work, but it’s not often there as a central focus.
And there was this idea, and my generation got it very early, that there would be two judgments at the end of your life.
And there was this idea, and my generation got it very early, that there would be two judgments at the end of your life. First, at the end of your particular life, you would be whipped away into eternity and you would undergo a particular judgment; your own life would be scanned, and rewards or punishments, or atonement, would be the result of that.

But the idea that you could gain merit through a system of grace and you could gain merit for other people, that self-denial had a spiritual meaning, and that there was a whole supernatural economy, that had strong appeal to me.

But you say that no place in the world prides itself more on its vigilance and realism than Northern Ireland, and I wondered how you felt that influence on your own work. Heaney:It would be very hard for me to analyze that. I take it that I am vigilant myself and a bit skeptical, and I hope merrily so, so that’s part of the makeup.
As an undergraduate at Queen’s University, of course I had been lectured on contemporary poetry, and I had read Eliot, I had read Auden. But I had also swallowed the standard line that contemporary poetry was urban, ironical, detached. I mean, the intonations of Eliot I could hear as a listener, but they didn’t enter me or waken anything in me in the way these other voices did.

Ashbery registers the truth-to-lifeness of the new world we live in.
Ashbery registers the truth-to-lifeness of the new world we live in. So I think it’s not just a matter of poetry being true in a novelistic kind of way, reporting what happens, but it’s true to the nature of reality, to the balance between the imagined and the endured, between the moral and the imagined and so on.

But it was a changing experience all right. I cancelled every appointment I had for readings, lectures, and so on for a year, and that had a good effect. It made me much more cautious about accepting invitations and made me realize how much I was on the road and how I should change my ways a bit.

I’ve said this often, but it came from reading poetry by Patrick Kavanagh, an Irish poet with the same kind of background as myself, a wonderful sudden burst of energy from him; and likewise from Ted Hughes, who again touched on subjects that I thought were known only to me, such as dead pigs lying in barrows, and bulls in outhouses, and barns and so on.

One part of you had the experience of going to confession and confessing sins of impurity, the other part of you is writing essays about Lawrence and commending the kind of dark gods and the sensual realities of life that he expressed. Wachtel: I have to ask you, did you ever say to your father that you loved him? How do you know that’s my father? [laughs]Wachtel: You’re right. Guilty as charged.
But the idea that you could gain merit through a system of grace and you could gain merit for other people, that self-denial had a spiritual meaning, and that there was a whole supernatural economy, that had strong appeal to me. Of course you dwell in doubts, as John Keats says, and you can dwell with doubts as well as with beliefs, but I think that all that was shaken.

Can you tell me a bit about him? Heaney:His work—his calling, really—involved him going out on the road to fairs, buying cattle there, and then bringing them back home and supplying other farmers.

I mean, there are no fair days in the way there used to be when local people drove the cattle into the main street of the local village, and there was a big assembly on the first Monday of every month or the second Tuesday of every month or whatever.

Wachtel: You’ve described him as a solid, quiet country man with country confidence. So he didn’t say that much? No, he didn’t speak that much, no.

He assumed that intuitive transmission was the real thing. If it was overstated, he tended to shy away from it. Wachtel:By overstated you mean stated.

What he did was find individual beasts and make individual deals at the fair and then on the farm. He was a very good judge of cattle and was much sought by people who wanted decent stock, and I suppose he was trusted also. Wachtel: You’ve described him as a solid, quiet country man with country confidence.
Heaney:His work—his calling, really—involved him going out on the road to fairs, buying cattle there, and then bringing them back home and supplying other farmers. Or he would get orders from local farmers and would go to the fairs to buy the beasts at a certain rate and bring them back and sell them at some profit or other. So he was a kind of middleman between small farmers and other cattle dealers. We’re talking about a culture now that has gone completely.

He celebrates the domestic sphere but always with an awareness of the world beyond.

His new collection, Human Chain, will be coming out this fall.

I still remember that, but I think that’s not uncommon, is it? What is stored bodily is very important for memory, and I think that other bodily sensations later on can bring it all back. Wachtel: I remember that image of the horse plough in your poem "Follower. It’s not just the land but the tools for engaging with it that are so vivid—from your earliest poems, such as "Digging, ” right up to recent ones.

Wachtel: You were born at Mossbawn Farm in County Derry, Northern Ireland, and you say these details are retold so often in introductions and bios that you can scarcely believe them yourself anymore, but all the same, what are your earliest memories of Mossbawn Farm?

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

So that was, as they say, permission. As an undergraduate at Queen’s University, of course I had been lectured on contemporary poetry, and I had read Eliot, I had read Auden.

I wanted the kids, really, to have the kind of childhood I’d had, I suppose; to share the feeling of growing up behind hedges and having eye-level contact with bird’s nests and leaves and flowers and so on. And there was something in myself that relished the frugality of life in the cottage, something that belonged in my first life, but it wasn’t a matter of fleeing the north. We lived as easily in Belfast as ever we had lived in the years leading up to the Troubles. It wasn’t a matter of feeling scared or being hunted out of the place or shaking the dust of the place off. It was very much to do with the option and the freedom of making a choice, embracing something different. In a sense, it was the first choice I deliberately made. I’ve often said that Marie and I, we were part of the scholarship generation. We got the scholarship to secondary school, we got the scholarship to the university, we got the scholarship to the teaching training college, we went into teaching, we got engaged, we got the mortgage, we got the house, we got the young family, and there we were. California was the first step off the conveyor belt, and when we came back we stepped farther off it.

Wachtel: You’ve described him as a solid, quiet country man with country confidence. So he didn’t say that much? No, he didn’t speak that much, no. I’ve often said my father regarded speech as a kind of affectation. He suspected the statement of too many good intentions and good sentiments. He assumed that intuitive transmission was the real thing.

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

It’s a far cry from Mossbawn, if you like, from the big noise of the shunting of an engine to the explosions of car bombs rattling the windows in Belfast; Bloody Sunday to Bloody Friday, both occurring in 1972. None of us quite had got the way of handling it. Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.
I think there was a confusion, perhaps, in my mind and in the minds of some of my teachers between the propagandist and the political. Political was kind of inculcated as a bad word in relation to art and poetry. Our great exemplar W. B. Yeats was ever against "opinion” in verse, but he was never afraid to deliver opinion.

Wachtel: And when you look back now, not that you need to spend much time revisiting it in your own work, but do you feel you walked the right line?
I wanted the kids, really, to have the kind of childhood I’d had, I suppose; to share the feeling of growing up behind hedges and having eye-level contact with bird’s nests and leaves and flowers and so on.
I wanted the kids, really, to have the kind of childhood I’d had, I suppose; to share the feeling of growing up behind hedges and having eye-level contact with bird’s nests and leaves and flowers and so on. And there was something in myself that relished the frugality of life in the cottage, something that belonged in my first life, but it wasn’t a matter of fleeing the north.

I was forty-seven, I think. My mother died in 1984, and my father died a couple of years later. And I think maybe that’s just a common experience; that you are next in line, there’s nothing over your head in terms of age, in terms of a parent.

You’re like a little drop of water in this great ocean, you’re a little speck in the whole scheme of things: nevertheless, you are being watched over, and watched over not only in terms of care but in terms of supervision to see you do nothing wrong.

I was paralyzed on my left side. Luckily, our very good friends were there on the spot, one of them a physiotherapist, so she came in and had a kind of calm talk. The ambulance services came very quickly and I was snatched straight to the hospital, which was an hour away, and en route I was hooked up to a drip that was very good for the circulation and so on.

I was wondering, also, how did winning the Nobel change your life?

I was wondering, also, how did winning the Nobel change your life? Heaney:I don’t really know the answer to that, to tell you the truth. I mean, it changed it in terms of invitations to do things, in terms of pressure of the mail, in terms of saying no to many things.

I wrote some poems as every literary undergraduate does, but it wasn’t until I was in my twenty-second or twenty- third year, 1962, that "that something” started in me. I’ve said this often, but it came from reading poetry by Patrick Kavanagh, an Irish poet with the same kind of background as myself, a wonderful sudden burst of energy from him; and likewise from Ted Hughes, who again touched on subjects that I thought were known only to me, such as dead pigs lying in barrows, and bulls in outhouses, and barns and so on.

If you take a contemporary American writer like John Ashbery, who a lot of people had, and probably still have, difficulty with—kind of whimsical, non sequitur kind of writing, channel surfing the language, going zigzag from sentence to sentence—he is true to life insofar as that is the way people’s minds are now, hopping from thing to thing.

If you’d been living in Warsaw or London, or Birmingham, or even Belfast where they were bombed during the war, you’d have a very different sense of what the world was, and maybe your make-believe would have been more defensive.

Heaney:First of all, in a poet like Frost, say, it describes the actual, it has a documentary quality. But that’s not the only sense in which you can be true to life. You can be true to it in terms of moral insight, in terms of ethical judgment, in realizing the imaginative dimensions of things. You can be true to it the way Wallace Stevens is true to it in a late poem like "The River of Rivers in Connecticut, ” or the way he’s true to it in an early, crazy, little lyric like "The bucks went clattering . ”I’ve forgotten which state they go clattering through. Or "The Emperor of Ice Cream, ” this kind of grand flourish—sportive, elegant, just play for its own sake in the domain of language. If you take a contemporary American writer like John Ashbery, who a lot of people had, and probably still have, difficulty with—kind of whimsical, non sequitur kind of writing, channel surfing the language, going zigzag from sentence to sentence—he is true to life insofar as that is the way people’s minds are now, hopping from thing to thing.

It coincided in my own life with a wonderful bout of writing a couple of years later—1988, 1989—a sequence of poems eventually called Squarings.
It coincided in my own life with a wonderful bout of writing a couple of years later—1988, 1989—a sequence of poems eventually called Squarings. They were terrifically free, and they began with an image of an unroofed wall-stead of an old ruined house and an image of the soul as a beggar standing in the doorway.

They were terrifically free, and they began with an image of an unroofed wall-stead of an old ruined house and an image of the soul as a beggar standing in the doorway. I suppose that particular image began to take hold of me— the idea of an unroofed space and the creature, soul-body, down here with nothing between it and the infinite.

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

I’ve got this cottage in County Wicklow. So at Easter, Marie and I and the kids went down to that cottage and we decided, yes, let’s make a go of it. I gave in my resignation, and in the month of August we saddled up, filled a van, and went down to the Glanmore cottage, stayed there for four years, and didn’t go back to Queen’s, didn’t go back to the north to dwell there at all. So it was a happy mixture of Ann’s philanthropy, as it were, and the growth point in our own lives. Wachtel: Once you did make the move, did it change how you saw the political situation? What effect did it have on your family, to move to the Republic? Heaney:I don’t think it had very much effect in terms of politics or anything like that. I mean, if I had been in the north, my attitude would have been the same. I wanted the kids, really, to have the kind of childhood I’d had, I suppose; to share the feeling of growing up behind hedges and having eye-level contact with bird’s nests and leaves and flowers and so on. And there was something in myself that relished the frugality of life in the cottage, something that belonged in my first life, but it wasn’t a matter of fleeing the north.

I mean, Spender, Auden, and Louis MacNeice—who’s an Irish poet of course, but part of that British generation—they had to deal with the Spanish Civil War, the rise of fascism, and so on.
I’ve said this often, but it came from reading poetry by Patrick Kavanagh, an Irish poet with the same kind of background as myself, a wonderful sudden burst of energy from him; and likewise from Ted Hughes, who again touched on subjects that I thought were known only to me, such as dead pigs lying in barrows, and bulls in outhouses, and barns and so on.

Luckily, our very good friends were there on the spot, one of them a physiotherapist, so she came in and had a kind of calm talk. The ambulance services came very quickly and I was snatched straight to the hospital, which was an hour away, and en route I was hooked up to a drip that was very good for the circulation and so on.

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

My head is furnished with medieval tools like sledgehammers and iron spikes to drive into walls and horse collars and so on.

In my last book I did a poem about a sledgehammer hitting a post, but I think it wasn’t just a physical sensation I was trying to get at. It was about the full exercise of merciless, violent power.

My mother died in 1984, and my father died a couple of years later.
My mother died in 1984, and my father died a couple of years later. And I think maybe that’s just a common experience; that you are next in line, there’s nothing over your head in terms of age, in terms of a parent.

None of us quite had got the way of handling it.
None of us quite had got the way of handling it. Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

Wachtel: You’ve described him as a solid, quiet country man with country confidence. So he didn’t say that much? No, he didn’t speak that much, no. I’ve often said my father regarded speech as a kind of affectation. He suspected the statement of too many good intentions and good sentiments.

It’s a far cry from Mossbawn, if you like, from the big noise of the shunting of an engine to the explosions of car bombs rattling the windows in Belfast; Bloody Sunday to Bloody Friday, both occurring in 1972.

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

So it was a happy mixture of Ann’s philanthropy, as it were, and the growth point in our own lives. Wachtel: Once you did make the move, did it change how you saw the political situation? What effect did it have on your family, to move to the Republic? Heaney:I don’t think it had very much effect in terms of politics or anything like that.

So I think it’s not just a matter of poetry being true in a novelistic kind of way, reporting what happens, but it’s true to the nature of reality, to the balance between the imagined and the endured, between the moral and the imagined and so on.

I mean, if I had been in the north, my attitude would have been the same. I wanted the kids, really, to have the kind of childhood I’d had, I suppose; to share the feeling of growing up behind hedges and having eye-level contact with bird’s nests and leaves and flowers and so on. And there was something in myself that relished the frugality of life in the cottage, something that belonged in my first life, but it wasn’t a matter of fleeing the north.
So at Easter, Marie and I and the kids went down to that cottage and we decided, yes, let’s make a go of it. I gave in my resignation, and in the month of August we saddled up, filled a van, and went down to the Glanmore cottage, stayed there for four years, and didn’t go back to Queen’s, didn’t go back to the north to dwell there at all.

So that kind of thing changed, but I don’t think it radically changed my sense of myself or what I was about as a writer.

So that’s my very first memory, undoubtedly.

It faced out to the local county road, and behind it, one field away, was the railway called the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway, which stopped operating sometime in the late 1950s, early 1960s.

His new collection, Human Chain, will be coming out this fall. Wachtel: You were born at Mossbawn Farm in County Derry, Northern Ireland, and you say these details are retold so often in introductions and bios that you can scarcely believe them yourself anymore, but all the same, what are your earliest memories of Mossbawn Farm?

And I think maybe that’s just a common experience; that you are next in line, there’s nothing over your head in terms of age, in terms of a parent.

That’s another matter, but that’s their Wachtel: That’s their problem. [laughs]Heaney:Yeah. Wachtel:You had a stroke in 2006, which you say wasn’t exactly a brush with death. What was it? Well, it was wakening up one morning in County Donegal in a guest house where we had been at a party with friends the night before and not being able to get out of the bed, making moves and nothing happening.

It’s a far cry from Mossbawn, if you like, from the big noise of the shunting of an engine to the explosions of car bombs rattling the windows in Belfast; Bloody Sunday to Bloody Friday, both occurring in 1972.

The matter of the sacraments, transubstantiation for example, gave me trouble at a certain stage. But the idea that you could gain merit through a system of grace and you could gain merit for other people, that self-denial had a spiritual meaning, and that there was a whole supernatural economy, that had strong appeal to me. Of course you dwell in doubts, as John Keats says, and you can dwell with doubts as well as with beliefs, but I think that all that was shaken. When you left the church atmosphere and grew into adulthood, at university, you were between worlds again. You knew that you belonged in a Catholic, medieval, Chaucerian, Dantesque world, and at the same time you were dwelling in a post-Freudian, post–D. H. Lawrence world. One part of you had the experience of going to confession and confessing sins of impurity, the other part of you is writing essays about Lawrence and commending the kind of dark gods and the sensual realities of life that he expressed. Wachtel: I have to ask you, did you ever say to your father that you loved him? How do you know that’s my father? [laughs]Wachtel: You’re right. Guilty as charged.

It luckily didn’t end up just a little nostalgic recreation of happy families on the sofa in the 1940s. It crossed with that sense that gradually came as one grew, how lucky we were not to be living the terrible, tragic life of others in mainland Europe and in Britain.

The stable was under the roof with the dwelling house, and one of the big comforting sounds quite often was the horse going nhrrrrrin the stable at the other end of the house. We didn’t have a fire on the hearth, but we did have water from the pump, and there were wells around the place.

They had love, Eros, sex, time, childhood, and yet there was the big war and the need for commitment. Communism was flowering as an ideology.

They were terrifically free, and they began with an image of an unroofed wall-stead of an old ruined house and an image of the soul as a beggar standing in the doorway.

I think the kind of attention that came with the Nobel Prize wasn’t any more acute or exacting than what we had suffered ourselves already, so I don’t think I’m misrepresenting my response to the prize. What is true is this, that other people see you differently once this garland is hung on you. That’s another matter, but that’s their Wachtel: That’s their problem. [laughs]Heaney:Yeah.

You can be true to it the way Wallace Stevens is true to it in a late poem like "The River of Rivers in Connecticut, ” or the way he’s true to it in an early, crazy, little lyric like "The bucks went clattering .
Wachtel: In your Nobel lecture in 1995, you credit poetry for its "truth to life, ” in every sense of that phrase. What were you thinking in terms of the senses of that phrase?

If you take a contemporary American writer like John Ashbery, who a lot of people had, and probably still have, difficulty with—kind of whimsical, non sequitur kind of writing, channel surfing the language, going zigzag from sentence to sentence—he is true to life insofar as that is the way people’s minds are now, hopping from thing to thing.

Wachtel: When you were writing as an undergraduate, you went under the name of Incertus or Uncertain, and then when you got this kind of affirmation to trust your own experience of rural life through, as you say, Ted Hughes or Patrick Kavanagh or even Robert Frost, it gave you this permission. But you say that no place in the world prides itself more on its vigilance and realism than Northern Ireland, and I wondered how you felt that influence on your own work. Heaney:It would be very hard for me to analyze that. I take it that I am vigilant myself and a bit skeptical, and I hope merrily so, so that’s part of the makeup. And allowing yourself to get through that is part of the action. I think that self-forgetfulness, self-entrancement, is part of the action of writing, certainly of writing verse. To dwell silently on something within yourself, to forget that you are there watching yourself in action, that’s the achievement and that’s the desire. And I think nowadays a lot of people really experience that in front of a screen. A computer screen is an entrancement device.

Wachtel: When your father died in 1986, you said the roof came off the world.
Wachtel: When your father died in 1986, you said the roof came off the world. Can you tell me what in particular that meant for you?

And I think maybe that’s just a common experience; that you are next in line, there’s nothing over your head in terms of age, in terms of a parent.

For anybody in my generation, certainly in the Irish Catholic generation, the soul was like a little white handkerchief, unstained, and you would stain it with sin and so on.

Wachtel: Your father was a cattle dealer. Can you tell me a bit about him?

Wachtel:You had a stroke in 2006, which you say wasn’t exactly a brush with death. What was it? Well, it was wakening up one morning in County Donegal in a guest house where we had been at a party with friends the night before and not being able to get out of the bed, making moves and nothing happening.

Many years later, I found a way of letting some people speak in a poem called "Station Island, ” which was a kind of a dialogue between a poet/protagonist and various ghosts—some who had been killed in the Troubles, some who had been involved in Irish life in the nineteenth century, and indeed the shade of James Joyce, who warns against too much side-taking, not to be the voice of any people, but to be your own voice.

I knew several, such as "The Shooting of Dan McGrew” from Robert Service, "The Spell the Yukon, ” "The Cremation of Sam McGee, ” and then an Irish writer called Percy French who wrote that kind of thing also. But it was when I went to secondary school, I suppose, and began to get into English literature and poetry as a subject, that something came alive in me to the language, something wakened or was stirred, especially by poets like John Keats, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and so on.

I’ve said this often, but it came from reading poetry by Patrick Kavanagh, an Irish poet with the same kind of background as myself, a wonderful sudden burst of energy from him; and likewise from Ted Hughes, who again touched on subjects that I thought were known only to me, such as dead pigs lying in barrows, and bulls in outhouses, and barns and so on.

So I went to hospital, was in intensive care for a day and a half, and then something terrific happened.
Well, it was wakening up one morning in County Donegal in a guest house where we had been at a party with friends the night before and not being able to get out of the bed, making moves and nothing happening.

Well, my earliest memory is of my foot touching the ground of Mossbawn, the County Derry earth, or rather a floor laid above the earth.

You can be true to it the way Wallace Stevens is true to it in a late poem like "The River of Rivers in Connecticut, ” or the way he’s true to it in an early, crazy, little lyric like "The bucks went clattering . ”I’ve forgotten which state they go clattering through.

Or "The Emperor of Ice Cream, ” this kind of grand flourish—sportive, elegant, just play for its own sake in the domain of language. If you take a contemporary American writer like John Ashbery, who a lot of people had, and probably still have, difficulty with—kind of whimsical, non sequitur kind of writing, channel surfing the language, going zigzag from sentence to sentence—he is true to life insofar as that is the way people’s minds are now, hopping from thing to thing.

So I think it’s not just a matter of poetry being true in a novelistic kind of way, reporting what happens, but it’s true to the nature of reality, to the balance between the imagined and the endured, between the moral and the imagined and so on.

And there was this idea, and my generation got it very early, that there would be two judgments at the end of your life. First, at the end of your particular life, you would be whipped away into eternity and you would undergo a particular judgment; your own life would be scanned, and rewards or punishments, or atonement, would be the result of that.

I was paralyzed on my left side. Luckily, our very good friends were there on the spot, one of them a physiotherapist, so she came in and had a kind of calm talk.
