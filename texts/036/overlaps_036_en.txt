This time, I touched down two weeks, two agonizing weeks, before I would board my plane, and the first thing I did was book an immediate red-eye home, hoping that if I got there early, I wouldn’t be too late.

"Dunno.
"Dunno. Don’t you think it’s cool to be special?
"Dunno. Don’t you think it’s cool to be special? It’s the one thing no one else can do but us."
"Dunno. Don’t you think it’s cool to be special? It’s the one thing no one else can do but us." She wagged a foot at the radiator.
"Hannah,” said my sister’s reflection in the glass pieces on the floor.
"Hannah,” said my sister’s reflection in the glass pieces on the floor. The gentle weight of her phantom hand on my shoulder burned, and time tugged at me again.

"Hannah,” said my sister’s reflection in the glass pieces on the floor. The gentle weight of her phantom hand on my shoulder burned, and time tugged at me again. "That’s enough." The blame circles back, hungry, and I recognize my own voice hissing from its mouth.

You could have stopped this, but you were blinded by your own ambition, your own selfishness; you let the haze of the city—the toxic glamour and crystalline cold—seduce you away from the people you love.

"I never meant to hurt you." Her ghost sighed as my hands blindly rearranged the components of reality. "I didn’t mean for you to see it. This was never about you, Hannah. I wish you’d realize that." The week before my sister ended the world, I didn’t go home.

The week before my sister ended the world, I didn’t go home. I stayed in the theater and broke every plate, every mug in the green room, hurling the shards in the faces of every person who’d come to court me.

At Melanie’s favorite bakery, where we’d ordered donuts as big as our heads the last time she’d come to visit, I ripped the boards out of the floor one by one, sending them flying through shattered windows.
"I understand,” Melanie had replied.
"I understand,” Melanie had replied. I could tell that she did.
"I understand,” Melanie had replied. I could tell that she did. I have followed the path back, again and again, to that first stream of possibility.
"I understand,” Melanie had replied. I could tell that she did. I have followed the path back, again and again, to that first stream of possibility. The events lined up so neatly that I could do them in my sleep, and sometimes did.
"I understand,” Melanie had replied. I could tell that she did. I have followed the path back, again and again, to that first stream of possibility. The events lined up so neatly that I could do them in my sleep, and sometimes did. They always led back to the desert monsoon, slogging through the water, my sister disappearing in a pillar of flame.

Why didn’t you want me there to help you? I wanted to ask. If you were this far gone, why didn’t you ask me to come home? I never got close enough to reach her through the wet- dust wind that snarled and roared around us, snatching my voice away.

"I wonder why we can do these things,” Melanie had said, closing her fist around the lightning glinting across her palm.
"I wonder why we can do these things,” Melanie had said, closing her fist around the lightning glinting across her palm. I grinned at her, reaching out to catch a bit of stray static dancing down her arm.

"It’ll end the same way.
"It’ll end the same way. Differently, but the same."
"It’ll end the same way. Differently, but the same." "Why?” I screamed.
"It’ll end the same way. Differently, but the same." "Why?” I screamed. The world crashed, bowed like wet rice paper, spilled inward.
"It’ll end the same way. Differently, but the same." "Why?” I screamed. The world crashed, bowed like wet rice paper, spilled inward. Our parents’ house a crater, the flame that was Melanie nowhere on the brightly lit grid of eventualities.

"That’s enough."
"That’s enough." The blame circles back, hungry, and I recognize my own voice hissing from its mouth.

"Thinking,” I croaked.

"What the hell are you doing?” said my roommate for the fifth time, leaning against the doorframe as he did in every iteration.
"What the hell are you doing?” said my roommate for the fifth time, leaning against the doorframe as he did in every iteration. My sullen eyes saw his every possibility splayed out before me like a fall of cards: roommate disappearing into the bathroom to find his medications gone; roommate leaving for work and returning too late; roommate blackened and burned as the apartment went up in smoke; roommate helping me into bed and turning the light off before heading back into the kitchen to bundle up all of the knives.

"What’s life like in the city?” Melanie had asked me when she’d come to visit me, the spring before she died.
"What’s life like in the city?” Melanie had asked me when she’d come to visit me, the spring before she died. I’d holed up in my dorm room to practice monologues for my senior showcase until my lungs burned, which probably meant I hadn’t been breathing properly anyhow, and Melanie had demanded that we go outside.

We’d settled in a donut shop about as big as Melanie’s closet back home and were crunched up, knees to chests, on the inside windowsill.

How the loneliness was crippling; how I’d been fired from three part-time jobs by now; how every day, on my way to class, I walked past the same madman in the tunnel moaning for Jesus, a mess of languages spilling from his bloody lips, past a banner ad that read: GET AWAY WITHOUT LEAVING NEW YORK.

We’d gone downtown, where well- dressed students and decently-dressed visitors crawled the streets, looking for artisanal french fries. We’d settled in a donut shop about as big as Melanie’s closet back home and were crunched up, knees to chests, on the inside windowsill. She’d looked good, wearing the pale pink sweater I’d secretly sent her for her birthday, fingernails painted the way they never could be at home. But she’d also looked so tired, sallow almost, her face lined with the weight of our parents’ words. All the things that my friends expected me to say—the city’s great, it’s exciting, I’m so lucky to live here, I love it—flashed through my head. So did the things I’d never told anyone, that I couldn’t tell anyone, because they wouldn’t want to hear it. How the loneliness was crippling; how I’d been fired from three part-time jobs by now; how every day, on my way to class, I walked past the same madman in the tunnel moaning for Jesus, a mess of languages spilling from his bloody lips, past a banner ad that read: GET AWAY WITHOUT LEAVING NEW YORK. "It’s different,” I’d said at last.
"Why?” I screamed.
"Why?” I screamed. The world crashed, bowed like wet rice paper, spilled inward.
"Why?” I screamed. The world crashed, bowed like wet rice paper, spilled inward. Our parents’ house a crater, the flame that was Melanie nowhere on the brightly lit grid of eventualities.

"You and your weird sleight of hand shit."
"You and your weird sleight of hand shit." He sighed and tossed me my iPhone.
"You and your weird sleight of hand shit." He sighed and tossed me my iPhone. "Your phone is ringing."
"You and your weird sleight of hand shit." He sighed and tossed me my iPhone. "Your phone is ringing." It took me a second to realize that the stupid anime song filtering out of the speakers was the one that Melanie liked, my ringtone for the home landline.

"You can’t change this, Hannah,” my sister’s ghost said as I tore the sky apart, shredding the fabric of air, of cloud, of matter and possibility.
"You can’t change this, Hannah,” my sister’s ghost said as I tore the sky apart, shredding the fabric of air, of cloud, of matter and possibility. The lightning danced for me now, bent and buckled for me the way it had only done for Melanie before.

"You’re being selfish,” my sister’s latest iteration said as I whipped the storm into a dark frenzy over the barren mountains.

How the loneliness was crippling; how I’d been fired from three part-time jobs by now; how every day, on my way to class, I walked past the same madman in the tunnel moaning for Jesus, a mess of languages spilling from his bloody lips, past a banner ad that read: GET AWAY WITHOUT LEAVING NEW YORK. "It’s different,” I’d said at last.

All your fault.
All your fault. You could have stopped this, but you were blinded by your own ambition, your own selfishness; you let the haze of the city—the toxic glamour and crystalline cold—seduce you away from the people you love.

And then there was nothing but me and my sister, her imprint, her echo. Melanie’s ghost sighed. "I expected better of you,” she said. The void roared back to life, and tossed me out again.

At Melanie’s favorite bakery, where we’d ordered donuts as big as our heads the last time she’d come to visit, I ripped the boards out of the floor one by one, sending them flying through shattered windows.

My sullen eyes saw his every possibility splayed out before me like a fall of cards: roommate disappearing into the bathroom to find his medications gone; roommate leaving for work and returning too late; roommate blackened and burned as the apartment went up in smoke; roommate helping me into bed and turning the light off before heading back into the kitchen to bundle up all of the knives.

Did they happen? Yes. No. The chain frays, spreads out like roots, possibilities endless. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. When Melanie and I were little, we’d lie on the carpet in the winter and warm our soggy feet by the radiator.

Don’t you think it’s cool to be special?

Even once in flight, the taste of glory lingered on my tongue the whole way home, sharp in the stale cabin air.

It was true, I was supposed to have a few more days to think of things, to fix them— "No one knows when God will take us home,” said my mother.
He sighed and tossed me my iPhone. "Your phone is ringing." It took me a second to realize that the stupid anime song filtering out of the speakers was the one that Melanie liked, my ringtone for the home landline. But it wasn’t her on the phone.

In my grief, I’d nearly forgotten about my sister, and in my absence, my apocalypse had shifted course without me.
Her ghost sighed as my hands blindly rearranged the components of reality.

Her tears fall into my eyes, sizzling and evaporating on contact, as the sky yawns above us, hungry, broken.
Her tears fall into my eyes, sizzling and evaporating on contact, as the sky yawns above us, hungry, broken. There are others, too, reaching back further along the daisy chain, when we were younger: slipping on ice, light cracking hard through my head; the agonizing sting of a scorpion on my arm, the stiffening of limbs, sudden tightness in my chest; Melanie in a dress for the first time, sobbing as our father screamed at her.

The next time, I ended the world by myself, during a power outage. Life blinked out, softly, and screamed back into being. The void spit the kitchen knife out at my feet, onto the floor of my Bushwick apartment, a taunt echoed in my perfect, intact wrists. You selfish bitch.

I reoriented the knife.
I reoriented the knife. "How many people are you going to destroy before you give up on me?"

And forward, along the lines that branch out, fuzzing the borders of the future’s shape: knives, dented, rejected by my gut; police sirens wailing, gunshots ringing into the crater where my city used to be, the scent of burnt sugar; a plane that never lands safely, erupting into flame on the runway.

This was when we still had a bad habit of jumping into snowbanks, exasperating our mom to no end. Melanie had just begun to learn how to melt shapes in the snow, the finest spark at the end of her index finger. "I wonder why we can do these things,” Melanie had said, closing her fist around the lightning glinting across her palm. I grinned at her, reaching out to catch a bit of stray static dancing down her arm. "Dunno. Don’t you think it’s cool to be special?

Life blinked out, softly, and screamed back into being.
Life blinked out, softly, and screamed back into being. The void spit the kitchen knife out at my feet, onto the floor of my Bushwick apartment, a taunt echoed in my perfect, intact wrists.

And forward, along the lines that branch out, fuzzing the borders of the future’s shape: knives, dented, rejected by my gut; police sirens wailing, gunshots ringing into the crater where my city used to be, the scent of burnt sugar; a plane that never lands safely, erupting into flame on the runway.

My sullen eyes saw his every possibility splayed out before me like a fall of cards: roommate disappearing into the bathroom to find his medications gone; roommate leaving for work and returning too late; roommate blackened and burned as the apartment went up in smoke; roommate helping me into bed and turning the light off before heading back into the kitchen to bundle up all of the knives.

"Thinking,” I croaked. My hands itched with electricity, sparks I couldn’t control dancing across my fingers. "You and your weird sleight of hand shit." He sighed and tossed me my iPhone. "Your phone is ringing." It took me a second to realize that the stupid anime song filtering out of the speakers was the one that Melanie liked, my ringtone for the home landline.

No, no, no.
No, no, no. Wrong again.
No, no, no. Wrong again. "I never meant to hurt you."
No, no, no. Wrong again. "I never meant to hurt you." Her ghost sighed as my hands blindly rearranged the components of reality.

And then there was nothing but me and my sister, her imprint, her echo. Melanie’s ghost sighed. "I expected better of you,” she said. The void roared back to life, and tossed me out again. So back to the city again, rewound further this time.

So did the things I’d never told anyone, that I couldn’t tell anyone, because they wouldn’t want to hear it. How the loneliness was crippling; how I’d been fired from three part-time jobs by now; how every day, on my way to class, I walked past the same madman in the tunnel moaning for Jesus, a mess of languages spilling from his bloody lips, past a banner ad that read: GET AWAY WITHOUT LEAVING NEW YORK.

The gentle weight of her phantom hand on my shoulder burned, and time tugged at me again. "That’s enough." The blame circles back, hungry, and I recognize my own voice hissing from its mouth. Your fault, Hannah. All your fault. You could have stopped this, but you were blinded by your own ambition, your own selfishness; you let the haze of the city—the toxic glamour and crystalline cold—seduce you away from the people you love. And it was true. Even once in flight, the taste of glory lingered on my tongue the whole way home, sharp in the stale cabin air. But Melanie and I had talked, we’d Skyped.

The lightning danced for me now, bent and buckled for me the way it had only done for Melanie before.

I’d holed up in my dorm room to practice monologues for my senior showcase until my lungs burned, which probably meant I hadn’t been breathing properly anyhow, and Melanie had demanded that we go outside.

She’d looked good, wearing the pale pink sweater I’d secretly sent her for her birthday, fingernails painted the way they never could be at home. But she’d also looked so tired, sallow almost, her face lined with the weight of our parents’ words.
The world ended anew with a shuddering sob, and I hit the ground running. This time, I touched down two weeks, two agonizing weeks, before I would board my plane, and the first thing I did was book an immediate red-eye home, hoping that if I got there early, I wouldn’t be too late. Wrong, wrong, wrong. "What’s life like in the city?” Melanie had asked me when she’d come to visit me, the spring before she died. I’d holed up in my dorm room to practice monologues for my senior showcase until my lungs burned, which probably meant I hadn’t been breathing properly anyhow, and Melanie had demanded that we go outside.

But she’d also looked so tired, sallow almost, her face lined with the weight of our parents’ words. All the things that my friends expected me to say—the city’s great, it’s exciting, I’m so lucky to live here, I love it—flashed through my head.
The world ended with a bang, folding in on itself, the lines of the horizon collapsing like soaked origami.
The world ended with a bang, folding in on itself, the lines of the horizon collapsing like soaked origami. Our parents’ house turned to glass, to fire, to energy sparking ripe and rich for the taking.

So back to the city again, rewound further this time.

There are others, too, reaching back further along the daisy chain, when we were younger: slipping on ice, light cracking hard through my head; the agonizing sting of a scorpion on my arm, the stiffening of limbs, sudden tightness in my chest; Melanie in a dress for the first time, sobbing as our father screamed at her.

And forward, along the lines that branch out, fuzzing the borders of the future’s shape: knives, dented, rejected by my gut; police sirens wailing, gunshots ringing into the crater where my city used to be, the scent of burnt sugar; a plane that never lands safely, erupting into flame on the runway.

There are timelines I don’t think about.
There are timelines I don’t think about. There is a timeline where the power never touches me, where I make it home in time for the party at the neighbor’s house, where a college boy’s hands are around my throat, not my sister’s, my legs kicking around his waist.

They always led back to the desert monsoon, slogging through the water, my sister disappearing in a pillar of flame. Why didn’t you want me there to help you? I wanted to ask. If you were this far gone, why didn’t you ask me to come home? I never got close enough to reach her through the wet- dust wind that snarled and roared around us, snatching my voice away. There are timelines I don’t think about. There is a timeline where the power never touches me, where I make it home in time for the party at the neighbor’s house, where a college boy’s hands are around my throat, not my sister’s, my legs kicking around his waist. Melanie scorches him to pieces, blackens him, shatters the boulders in the wash, and howls until her voice bleeds. Her tears fall into my eyes, sizzling and evaporating on contact, as the sky yawns above us, hungry, broken. There are others, too, reaching back further along the daisy chain, when we were younger: slipping on ice, light cracking hard through my head; the agonizing sting of a scorpion on my arm, the stiffening of limbs, sudden tightness in my chest; Melanie in a dress for the first time, sobbing as our father screamed at her.
This time I didn’t break anything.

For a week, I didn’t speak unless I was using someone else’s words. The night before boarding the plane, I found myself whispering my secrets into the frigid night air, combing the space between skyscrapers with my tongue.

This time, I touched down two weeks, two agonizing weeks, before I would board my plane, and the first thing I did was book an immediate red-eye home, hoping that if I got there early, I wouldn’t be too late.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. "What’s life like in the city?” Melanie had asked me when she’d come to visit me, the spring before she died. I’d holed up in my dorm room to practice monologues for my senior showcase until my lungs burned, which probably meant I hadn’t been breathing properly anyhow, and Melanie had demanded that we go outside.

We’d settled in a donut shop about as big as Melanie’s closet back home and were crunched up, knees to chests, on the inside windowsill.

This was when we still had a bad habit of jumping into snowbanks, exasperating our mom to no end.

We’d settled in a donut shop about as big as Melanie’s closet back home and were crunched up, knees to chests, on the inside windowsill. She’d looked good, wearing the pale pink sweater I’d secretly sent her for her birthday, fingernails painted the way they never could be at home. But she’d also looked so tired, sallow almost, her face lined with the weight of our parents’ words. All the things that my friends expected me to say—the city’s great, it’s exciting, I’m so lucky to live here, I love it—flashed through my head. So did the things I’d never told anyone, that I couldn’t tell anyone, because they wouldn’t want to hear it.

When Melanie and I were little, we’d lie on the carpet in the winter and warm our soggy feet by the radiator. This was when we still had a bad habit of jumping into snowbanks, exasperating our mom to no end. Melanie had just begun to learn how to melt shapes in the snow, the finest spark at the end of her index finger.

Why didn’t you want me there to help you?

I never got close enough to reach her through the wet- dust wind that snarled and roared around us, snatching my voice away. There are timelines I don’t think about. There is a timeline where the power never touches me, where I make it home in time for the party at the neighbor’s house, where a college boy’s hands are around my throat, not my sister’s, my legs kicking around his waist.

There are others, too, reaching back further along the daisy chain, when we were younger: slipping on ice, light cracking hard through my head; the agonizing sting of a scorpion on my arm, the stiffening of limbs, sudden tightness in my chest; Melanie in a dress for the first time, sobbing as our father screamed at her.

And forward, along the lines that branch out, fuzzing the borders of the future’s shape: knives, dented, rejected by my gut; police sirens wailing, gunshots ringing into the crater where my city used to be, the scent of burnt sugar; a plane that never lands safely, erupting into flame on the runway.
Wrong again.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. "What’s life like in the city?” Melanie had asked me when she’d come to visit me, the spring before she died.

"How many people are you going to destroy before you give up on me?" ”Five times, five lines, lead and edges and crushed pills all yanked out of me, spit back further and further each time."

My sullen eyes saw his every possibility splayed out before me like a fall of cards: roommate disappearing into the bathroom to find his medications gone; roommate leaving for work and returning too late; roommate blackened and burned as the apartment went up in smoke; roommate helping me into bed and turning the light off before heading back into the kitchen to bundle up all of the knives.
