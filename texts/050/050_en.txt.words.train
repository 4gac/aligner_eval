what i asked was a little fast (empty)
(other) out this (other) of my (other) and (other) (other) the (other) (other) i had (other) (other) (other) at and then (other) and (other) to the (other) of (other) had been (other) down the (other) at 113 (other) an (other) (empty)
that's more than a little fast i said (empty)
he (other) (empty)
in fact he (other) (other) and (other) (empty)
he did not object when i told him (other) have to (other) the (other) and probably for a (other) (empty)

he was in fact almost (other) (other) (empty)
he even (other) that the (other) did the right thing in (other) him for as he put it we (other) all go around doing 113 (empty)
he did however object to one thing (empty)
he didn't like it that one of the (other) (other) he (other) was for reckless driving (empty)
well i (other) (other) an (other) to (other) yell at him what (other) you call it (empty)
it's just not (other) he said (other) (empty)
reckless (other) like you're not (other) attention (empty)

my (other) high speed (other) (other) the question long asked by people who have (other) the (other) of humans we call teenagers (empty)
what on (other) was he doing (empty)
parents often (other) this question more (other) (empty)
but even that is just another way of (other) what is wrong with these kids (empty)
why do they act this way (empty)
the question (other) (other) even as it (other) (empty)
through the (other) most (other) have (other) dark (other) that (other) (other) the teen (empty)

these imaging (other) offered a new way to (other) the same (other) wrong with these kids and (other) an answer that (other) almost (other) (empty)

this (other) of (other) (other) thought to be (other) (other) by (other) (other) (other) throughout adolescence (empty)
imaging work done since the (other) shows that these physical changes move in a (other) (other) from the brain's (other) to its front from areas (other) to the brain (other) that look after (other) and more (other) basic functions such as (other) movement and fundamental (other) to the (other) (other) and more complicated thinking areas up front (empty)

in fact by age 15 they can (other) as well as adults if they're (other) (other) (other) about (other) to (other) percent of the time (empty)

(other) (other) or (other) can (other) a (other) (empty)
they act that way because their brains (other) done (empty)
you can see it right (other) in the scans (empty)
this view as (other) from the (other) of scientific (other) and popular (other) about the teen brain put it (other) (other) as works in progress (other) (other) brains lead some to question (other) they are in a state (other) to (other) (other) (empty)
the story you're (other) right now however (other) a (other) scientific (other) about the teen brain (empty)
over the past (other) years or so even as the work in progress story spread into our (other) the (other) of adolescent brain studies (other) to do some more complex thinking of its own (empty)

the (other) (other) of the adolescent (other) it the adaptive adolescent (other) the teen less as a (other) (other) than as an (other) (other) highly (other) (other) (other) almost (other) for the (other) of moving from the (other) of home into the complicated world (other) (empty)
this view will (other) (other) better with teens (empty)
more (other) it (other) better with (other) most fundamental (other) that of (other) selection (empty)
selection is (other) on (other) traits (empty)
if adolescence is (other) a (other) of (other) (other) and (other) (other) (other) and reckless (other) (other) did those traits (other) selection (empty)
they (other) if they (other) the (other) most fundamental or (other) (other) (empty)
the answer is that those (other) traits don't really (other) adolescence they're just what we (other) most because they (other) us or put our (other) in (other) (empty)
as (other) (other) casey a (other) at (other) (other) (other) (other) who has spent (other) a (other) (other) brain and genetic studies to our understanding of adolescence (other) it (other) so used to (other) adolescence as a problem (empty)
but the more we (other) about what really makes this period (other) the more adolescence starts to (other) like a highly (other) even adaptive period (empty)
it's (other) what (other) need to do the things you have to do then (empty)
to see past the (other) (other) teenager and (other) the adaptive adolescent (other) we (other) look not at (other) sometimes (other) behaviors such as (other) down (other) or (other) fast company but at the (other) traits that (other) those (other) (empty)
(other) (other) with the teen's love of the thrill (empty)
we all like new and (other) things but we (other) (other) them more highly than we do during adolescence (empty)
(other) we (other) a high in what (other) (other) call sensation seeking the (other) for the neural (other) the (other) of the (other) or (other) (empty)
seeking sensation (other) (other) (other) (empty)
you might (other) a sensation seeking experience a (other) or a fast (other) (other) as my son did (empty)
(other) generally (other) throughout life (other) at about age (other) but this love of the thrill peaks at around age 15 (empty)
and although sensation seeking can lead to (other) behaviors it can also (other) (other) (other) (empty)
the (other) to (other) more people for instance can (other) a (other) (other) of (other) which generally makes us (other) (other) (other) and more (other) (empty)
this (other) probably (other) why an (other) to the new (other) it can sometimes (other) the cat (other) a (other) of adolescent development (empty)

in the (other) (other) one in (other) teen (other) is from (other) (other) many (other) alcohol (empty)
are these kids just (other) (other) (empty)
that's the (other) explanation they're not thinking or by the work in progress (other) their puny developing brains (other) them (empty)
yet these explanations don't (other) up (empty)
as (other) steinberg a (other) (other) (other) in adolescence at (other) (other) (other) out even (other) to 17 year (other) (other) risk (other) the same basic (other) (other) that adults do and they (other) reason their way through (other) just as well as adults (empty)
(other) to popular (other) they also (other) recognize they're (other) (empty)
and like adults says steinberg teens actually (other) risk (empty)
so if teens think as well as adults do and recognize risk just as well why do they take more chances (empty)
the adults meanwhile (other) no (other) with a friend (other) (empty)
to steinberg this shows (other) that risk (other) (other) not from puny thinking but from a (other) (other) for reward (empty)
they didn't take more chances because they (other) (other) the risk says steinberg (empty)
they did so because they (other) more (other) to the (other) (empty)
researchers such as steinberg and casey (other) this risk (other) (other) of (other) (other) reward has been (other) for because over the (other) of human evolution the (other) to take risks during this period of life has (other) an adaptive (other) (empty)
