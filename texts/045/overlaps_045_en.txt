Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.
A more logical scenario was devised around the possibility that Thutmose III needed to reinforce the legitimacy of his son Amenhotep II's succession in the face of rival claims from other family members. And Hatshepsut, once disparaged for ruthless ambition, is now admired for her political skill.

Over a four-month period in late 2006 and early 2007, the mummies passed through a CT scanner that enabled the archaeologists to examine them in detail and to gauge their age and cause of death.

For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had huge pendulous breasts of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse.

She probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes. Hawass speculates that the high priests of Amun may have moved her body to the tomb of her nurse to protect it from looters; many royalty of the New Kingdom were hidden in secret tombs for security. As for the DNA tests, the first round began in April 2007 and has shown nothing definitive. With ancient specimens you never have a 100 percent match, because the genetic sequences aren't complete, says Angélique Corthals, a professor of biomedicine and forensic studies at Stony Brook University in New York and one of three consultants working with the Egyptians. We looked at mitochondrial DNA for the suspected Hatshepsut mummy and her grandmother Ahmose Nefertari. There is about a 30 to 35 percent chance that the two samples are not related, but I cannot emphasize enough that these are just preliminary results. Another round of tests may soon deliver a clearer verdict.

Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris.

If the embalmer hadn't picked it up and put it in with the liver, there is no way we would have known what happened to Hatshepsut, Hawass says.
And the box inscribed with Hatshepsut's cartouche is not the typical canopic vessel in which mummified organs are found. It's made of wood, not stone, and might have been used to hold jewelry or oils or small valuables. Some would say we have not found absolute proof, Selim says. And I would agree.

Already the CT scans have changed history, dispelling theories that Hatshepsut might have been killed by her stepson.

She probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes.

Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris.

As for the DNA tests, the first round began in April 2007 and has shown nothing definitive. With ancient specimens you never have a 100 percent match, because the genetic sequences aren't complete, says Angélique Corthals, a professor of biomedicine and forensic studies at Stony Brook University in New York and one of three consultants working with the Egyptians.

At Deir el Bahri, the site of her most spectacular architectural achievement, her statues were smashed and thrown into a pit in front of her mortuary temple. Known as Djeser Djeseru, holy of holies, on the west bank of the Nile across from modern Luxor, the temple is set against a bay of lion-colored cliffs that frame the tawny temple stones the way the nemes frames a pharaoh's face.

By the time excavators cleared the debris from the mostly buried temple in the late 1890s, the mystery of Hatshepsut had been refined: What kind of ruler was she?
At Deir el Bahri, the site of her most spectacular architectural achievement, her statues were smashed and thrown into a pit in front of her mortuary temple. Known as Djeser Djeseru, holy of holies, on the west bank of the Nile across from modern Luxor, the temple is set against a bay of lion-colored cliffs that frame the tawny temple stones the way the nemes frames a pharaoh's face. With its three tiers, its porticoes, its spacious ramp-linked terraces, its now vanished sphinx-lined causeway and T-shaped papyrus pools and shade- casting myrrh trees, Djeser Djeseru is among the most glorious temples ever built. It was designed (perhaps by Senenmut) to be the center of Hatshepsut's cult.

The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power.

When archaeologists discovered evidence in the 1960s indicating that the banishment of King Hatshepsut had begun at least 20 years after her death, the soap opera of a hotheaded stepson wreaking vengeance on his unscrupulous stepmother fell apart.

By the time excavators cleared the debris from the mostly buried temple in the late 1890s, the mystery of Hatshepsut had been refined: What kind of ruler was she? The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power.

William C.

Three years later another archaeologist removed the mummy in the coffin to the Egyptian Museum. The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

The thin mummy was retrieved from storage in the museum's attic; the fat one, KV60a, which had remained in the tomb where it had been found, was transported from the Valley of the Kings.

Over a four-month period in late 2006 and early 2007, the mummies passed through a CT scanner that enabled the archaeologists to examine them in detail and to gauge their age and cause of death.

The team dentist identified it as a secondary molar with part of its root missing.
Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60. The thin mummy was retrieved from storage in the museum's attic; the fat one, KV60a, which had remained in the tomb where it had been found, was transported from the Valley of the Kings.

We didn't know how much had been moved around by Howard Carter, so we documented it as an intact site. In a side chamber Ryan found a huge pile of wrappings, a mummified cow's leg, and a stacked pile of victual mummies, wrapped bundles of food laid up for the deceased's long journey through eternity. The more Ryan studied the mummy, the more he thought she might be someone important. She was extraordinarily well mummified, he says. And she was striking a royal pose. I thought, Why, she's a queen!

Think of this program as a guidebook for conscious modeling with greater precision, a chance for you to become conscious of something you've always been doing in your life. If someone is doing something outstanding, the immediate question that should pop in your mind is, How does (s)he create that result? CHAPTER II - KEY POINTS It's a funny thing about life; if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it.
How does a child learn to speak? We live in a culture that's consistent enough so that what works in one place will very often work in another. The world's greatest modelers are the Japanese.

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

Henry David Thoreau: Success leaves clues.
If someone is doing something outstanding, the immediate question that should pop in your mind is, How does (s)he create that result? CHAPTER II - KEY POINTS It's a funny thing about life; if you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it. W. Somerset Maugham: People who succeed do not have fewer problems than people who fail. The only people without problems are those in cemeteries. It's not what happens to us that separates failures from successes. It is how we perceive it and what we do about what happens that makes the difference. Things do not change; we change. Henry David Thoreau: Success leaves clues. I believe that if I precisely duplicate the actions of others, I can reproduce the same quality of results.
If the embalmer hadn't picked it up and put it in with the liver, there is no way we would have known what happened to Hatshepsut, Hawass says.
If the embalmer hadn't picked it up and put it in with the liver, there is no way we would have known what happened to Hatshepsut, Hawass says. Already the CT scans have changed history, dispelling theories that Hatshepsut might have been killed by her stepson.

Already the CT scans have changed history, dispelling theories that Hatshepsut might have been killed by her stepson. She probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes.

With ancient specimens you never have a 100 percent match, because the genetic sequences aren't complete, says Angélique Corthals, a professor of biomedicine and forensic studies at Stony Brook University in New York and one of three consultants working with the Egyptians.

Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris.

Three years later another archaeologist removed the mummy in the coffin to the Egyptian Museum. The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had huge pendulous breasts of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse.
In a 19-year span he led 17 military campaigns in the Levant, including a victory against the Canaanites at Megiddo in present-day Israel that is still taught in military academies. He had a flock of wives, one of whom bore his successor, Amenhotep II. Thutmose III also found time to introduce the chicken to the Egyptian dinner table. In the latter part of his life, when other men might be content to reminisce about bygone adventures, Thutmose III appears to have taken up another pastime. He decided to methodically wipe his stepmother, the king, out of history.

The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

I believed that if I precisely duplicated the actions of others, I could reproduce the same quality of results that they had.
It is how we perceive what happens and what we do about what happens that makes the difference. Think of W. Mitchell's two terrible accidents, and contrast it with John Belushi's external success. W. Mitchell chose to consistently communicate to himself that his experience had occurred for a purpose. His internal communication formed sets of beliefs and values that continued to direct his life from a sense of advantage rather than tragedy - even after he was burned and paralyzed.

This is called MODELING - If you precisely reproduce the specific mental and physical actions of another person, you will get the same results - if it's possible for others in the world, it's possible for you.

When archaeologists discovered evidence in the 1960s indicating that the banishment of King Hatshepsut had begun at least 20 years after her death, the soap opera of a hotheaded stepson wreaking vengeance on his unscrupulous stepmother fell apart.

A more logical scenario was devised around the possibility that Thutmose III needed to reinforce the legitimacy of his son Amenhotep II's succession in the face of rival claims from other family members.

A more logical scenario was devised around the possibility that Thutmose III needed to reinforce the legitimacy of his son Amenhotep II's succession in the face of rival claims from other family members. And Hatshepsut, once disparaged for ruthless ambition, is now admired for her political skill.
It was designed (perhaps by Senenmut) to be the center of Hatshepsut's cult. Images of her as queen were left undisturbed, but wherever she had proclaimed herself king, the workers of her stepson followed with their chisels, the vandalism careful and precise. The destruction was not an emotional decision; it was a political decision, says Zbigniew Szafrański, the director of the Polish archaeological mission to Egypt that has been working at Hatshepsut's mortuary temple since 1961. By the time excavators cleared the debris from the mostly buried temple in the late 1890s, the mystery of Hatshepsut had been refined: What kind of ruler was she? The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power.

Known as Djeser Djeseru, holy of holies, on the west bank of the Nile across from modern Luxor, the temple is set against a bay of lion-colored cliffs that frame the tawny temple stones the way the nemes frames a pharaoh's face.
Known as Djeser Djeseru, holy of holies, on the west bank of the Nile across from modern Luxor, the temple is set against a bay of lion-colored cliffs that frame the tawny temple stones the way the nemes frames a pharaoh's face. With its three tiers, its porticoes, its spacious ramp-linked terraces, its now vanished sphinx-lined causeway and T-shaped papyrus pools and shade- casting myrrh trees, Djeser Djeseru is among the most glorious temples ever built.

Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris.

Last spring photographer Kenneth Garrett asked Wafaa El Saddik, director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, to review a list of Hatshepsut treasures he hoped to photograph for this article: a limestone sphinx of Hatshepsut from the ruins of her temple, the wooden box containing the tooth, a limestone bust of Hatshepsut in the guise of the underworld god Osiris. El Saddik came to the final item on the list: the mummified body of Hatshepsut herself. You want us to remove the glass? she asked incredulously, as if the mummy, long neglected, now possessed something unspeakably precious. The photographer nodded. The director shuddered. This is the history of the world we're talking about! she exclaimed. In the end, it was decreed that one of the panels of glass could be removed from the case in the Royal Mummy Room without jeopardizing the history of the world. Staring at what was left of the great female pharaoh as the lights were being set up, I found myself wondering why it was so important to authenticate her corpse.

But if your result is depression, there are specific ways you are communicating with yourself - e. g. , things you are doing with your body, the tonality with which you talk to yourself, the way you picture your life - it takes effort to produce any result. Your job is similar to a film director's job - you need to manipulate what (the way you communicate to yourself). COMMUNICATION IS POWER. you see and hear We're in an information age, but information is not enough.

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Ted Turner, Tina Turner, Pete Rose, and Dean Barbara Black of the Columbia University School of Law, are people that applied the Ultimate Success Formula in their lives, and who also shared what I believe are seven fundamental character traits that they have all cultivated within themselves that give them the fire to do whatever it takes to succeed. 7 FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER TRAITS OF SUCCESS 1) PASSION - gives life power, juice, and meaning.

This is called MODELING - If you precisely reproduce the specific mental and physical actions of another person, you will get the same results - if it's possible for others in the world, it's possible for you.

Once you've found a person with an aspect that you would like to model, begin to ask questions that relate to that person's belief system. How to duplicate mental syntax and physiology will be dealt with in Chapters VII and IX, respectively. The foundation of modeling lies in a person's belief systems. Ask him or her questions about what they believe about their success in the area that you're modeling. Let's say you admire someone's marriage, for example, and you decide you would like to find out what the husband does that seems to cause his wife to love and respect him so much. So you begin: Sam, what do you BELIEVE that makes you such a good husband? Now, Sam may say something like, I don't know - I'm lucky, I guess. So you'll have to probe further, Well, if you did know what you believed about marriage and your wife that makes you successful in your marriage, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Ted Turner, Tina Turner, Pete Rose, and Dean Barbara Black of the Columbia University School of Law, are people that applied the Ultimate Success Formula in their lives, and who also shared what I believe are seven fundamental character traits that they have all cultivated within themselves that give them the fire to do whatever it takes to succeed. 7 FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER TRAITS OF SUCCESS 1) PASSION - gives life power, juice, and meaning. There is no greatness without a passion to be great - great parent, athlete, scientist, artist, businessperson (see Chapter XI) 2) BELIEF - passion and belief provide the fuel toward excellence (see Chapters IV, V) 3) STRATEGY - a way of organizing resources (Chapters VII, VIII) 4) CLARITY OF VALUES - the fundamental ethical, moral, and practical evaluations we make about what's most important in our lives (Chapter XVIII) 5) ENERGY - people of excellence have all have the energy to take opportunities and shape them (Chapters IX, X) 6) RAPPORT-BONDING POWER - the ability to connect with people at a deepest levels of your heart (Chapter XIII) 7) MASTERY OF COMMUNICATION - the essence of what this book is about.

Think of this program as a guidebook for conscious modeling with greater precision, a chance for you to become conscious of something you've always been doing in your life. If someone is doing something outstanding, the immediate question that should pop in your mind is, How does (s)he create that result?

The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power.
The answer seemed self-evident to a number of Egyptologists quick to embrace the idea that Thutmose III had attacked Hatshepsut's memory as revenge for her shameless usurpation of his royal power. William C. Hayes, the curator of Egyptian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a principal at the Deir el Bahri excavations in the 1920s and '30s, wrote in 1953: It was not long … before this vain, ambitious, and unscrupulous woman showed herself in her true colors.

When archaeologists discovered evidence in the 1960s indicating that the banishment of King Hatshepsut had begun at least 20 years after her death, the soap opera of a hotheaded stepson wreaking vengeance on his unscrupulous stepmother fell apart.

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

The thin mummy was retrieved from storage in the museum's attic; the fat one, KV60a, which had remained in the tomb where it had been found, was transported from the Valley of the Kings.

The evidence of her supposed cruelty was the payback she posthumously received when her stepson had her monuments attacked and her kingly name erased from public memorials. Indeed, Thutmose III did as thorough a job smiting the iconography of King Hatshepsut as he had whacking the Canaanites at Megiddo.

At Karnak her image and cartouche, or name symbol, were chiseled off shrine walls; the texts on her obelisks were covered with stone (which had the unintended effect of keeping them in pristine condition).

The power to magically transform our lives into our greatest dreams lies waiting within us all. It's time to unleash that power! Power is a very emotional word for many people, and has a negative connotation for some people, but to me, ultimate power is the ability to produce the results you desire most and create value for others in the process. Real power is shared, not imposed. It's the ability to define human needs and fulfill them both your needs and the needs of the people you care about.

The cache of royal mummies contains a tooth that exactly matches a hole in the smile of a mummy found next to the beloved nurse of Egypt's great female pharaoh?

She probably died of an infection caused by an abscessed tooth, with complications from advanced bone cancer and possibly diabetes.
The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse.
The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

That changed in June 1989, when Donald Ryan, an Egyptologist and lecturer at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, came to explore several small, undecorated tombs in the valley.

He wandered over to the entrance of KV19 and for the heck of it, thinking KV60 might be nearby, started sweeping the entranceway with his broom.

A week later, with Beethoven's Pathétique Sonata playing on a tape deck, he and a local antiquities inspector entered the lost tomb.

In a side chamber Ryan found a huge pile of wrappings, a mummified cow's leg, and a stacked pile of victual mummies, wrapped bundles of food laid up for the deceased's long journey through eternity.

Before he closed the tomb, Ryan and a colleague tidied the burial chamber up a bit. At a local carpenter's shop they had a simple coffin built.

The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

Carter made another discovery in a tomb close by—tomb KV60, a minor structure whose entrance was cut into the corridor entrance of KV19.

The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

We found the smashed-up face piece of a coffin and flecks of gold that had been scraped off, he recalls. We didn't know how much had been moved around by Howard Carter, so we documented it as an intact site.

Part 2: Discover what you really want in your life and communicate more effectively with others. Part 3: Discover what motivates us, what we can contribute on a larger, global scale. What if there was a way to take action that greatly accelerated the learning process - what if you could learn in minutes what someone took years to perfect? MODELING! - see Chapter II. CHAPTER I - KEY POINTS What we do (our results) in life is determined by how we communicate to ourselves. In the modern world. THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS THE QUALITY OF OUR COMMUNICATION.
This is called MODELING - If you precisely reproduce the specific mental and physical actions of another person, you will get the same results - if it's possible for others in the world, it's possible for you.

Richard Bandler and John Grinder, co-founders of NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) found that there are three forms of mental and physical actions that correspond most directly to the quality of results we produce.

It struck me how much more of Hatshepsut was alive in her texts, where even after so many thousands of years, you can still feel the flutter of her heart.

Three years later another archaeologist removed the mummy in the coffin to the Egyptian Museum. The inscription on the coffin was later linked to Hatshepsut's nurse. The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

That changed in June 1989, when Donald Ryan, an Egyptologist and lecturer at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, came to explore several small, undecorated tombs in the valley.

He wandered over to the entrance of KV19 and for the heck of it, thinking KV60 might be nearby, started sweeping the entranceway with his broom.

For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had huge pendulous breasts of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse.

In a 19-year span he led 17 military campaigns in the Levant, including a victory against the Canaanites at Megiddo in present-day Israel that is still taught in military academies. He had a flock of wives, one of whom bore his successor, Amenhotep II. Thutmose III also found time to introduce the chicken to the Egyptian dinner table. In the latter part of his life, when other men might be content to reminisce about bygone adventures, Thutmose III appears to have taken up another pastime. He decided to methodically wipe his stepmother, the king, out of history. When Zahi Hawass set out to find Her Majesty King Hatshepsut, he was fairly certain of one thing: The naked mummy found resting on the floor of a minor tomb was not her. When I started searching for Hatshepsut, I never thought I would discover that she was this mummy, Hawass says. For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had huge pendulous breasts of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse. Months earlier Hawass had visited Hatshepsut's tomb, KV20, to search for clues to her whereabouts.
To be sure, the scientists have proved only that a tooth in a box belongs to a mummy.
To be sure, the scientists have proved only that a tooth in a box belongs to a mummy. The identification is based on the assumption that the contents of the box are properly labeled and were once vital parts of the famous female pharaoh.

The cache of royal mummies contains a tooth that exactly matches a hole in the smile of a mummy found next to the beloved nurse of Egypt's great female pharaoh?

The longer I stared at Hatshepsut, the more I recoiled from those unfathomable eyes and the suffocating fixity of that lifeless flesh. Most of us live by the lapwing creed that is the antithesis of the pharaohs' faith: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. It struck me how much more of Hatshepsut was alive in her texts, where even after so many thousands of years, you can still feel the flutter of her heart.

But if your result is depression, there are specific ways you are communicating with yourself - e. g. , things you are doing with your body, the tonality with which you talk to yourself, the way you picture your life - it takes effort to produce any result.
What we do (our results) in life is determined by how we communicate to ourselves. In the modern world. THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS THE QUALITY OF OUR COMMUNICATION. How you feel is the direct result of how you communicate to yourself - your interpretation of what is happening. NOTHING HAS ANY MEANING EXCEPT THE MEANING WE GIVE IT.

The mummy on the floor was left as she was, as she had been since being stashed there, probably by priests during the reburials of the 21st dynasty, around 1000 B. C. Over the years Egyptologists lost track of the entrance to KV60, and the mummy on the tomb floor effectively disappeared.

In KV60 Carter found two much denuded mummies of women and some mummified geese.
When I started searching for Hatshepsut, I never thought I would discover that she was this mummy, Hawass says. For starters, she had no apparent regal bearing; she was fat, and as Hawass wrote in an article published in the journal KMT, she had huge pendulous breasts of the sort more likely to be found on Hatshepsut's wet nurse. Months earlier Hawass had visited Hatshepsut's tomb, KV20, to search for clues to her whereabouts. Wearing his trademark fedora, Hawass lowered himself 700 feet into one of the most dangerous tombs in the Valley of the Kings. The tunnel through friable shale and limestone reeked of bat droppings. When Howard Carter cleared it in 1903, he called it one of the most irksome pieces of work I ever supervised.

When Zahi Hawass set out to find Her Majesty King Hatshepsut, he was fairly certain of one thing: The naked mummy found resting on the floor of a minor tomb was not her.

A more logical scenario was devised around the possibility that Thutmose III needed to reinforce the legitimacy of his son Amenhotep II's succession in the face of rival claims from other family members. And Hatshepsut, once disparaged for ruthless ambition, is now admired for her political skill. Nobody can know what she was like, says Catharine Roehrig, now a curator in the same department once headed by Hayes.

Close to two decades after Donald Ryan rediscovered the location of KV60, Zahi Hawass asked the curators at the Egyptian Museum to round up all the unidentified and possibly royal female mummies from the 18th dynasty, including the two bodies—one thin, one fat—that had been found in KV60.

With ancient specimens you never have a 100 percent match, because the genetic sequences aren't complete, says Angélique Corthals, a professor of biomedicine and forensic studies at Stony Brook University in New York and one of three consultants working with the Egyptians.
