A Buddhist temple, right there in Kissimmee, Eric said. I took off my shoes and went inside. I loved the calm, the serenity. It changed my life.

Four decades after Disney's fateful flyover, Orlando is a place of enormous vitality, diversity, ugliness, discord, inventiveness, possibility, and disappointed hopes, where no clown in a character costume can tell people how to live, let alone where to park. On the afternoon of Wednesday, February 2, 2005, thousands in Orlando got a shock when they turned on their car radios for the drive home. The Supremes had been banished;Kenny Rogers had been given the boot. Without warning or explanation, FM 100.3, Orlando's famous golden oldies station (known as the Big 100s), had vanished. Rumba 100.3, new home of central Florida's hottest Latin sounds, had taken its place. To oldies fans, it was as though Hispanics with boomboxes had somehow gotten inside the car.

If the moon were ever settled, this is how it would be done. Whole neighborhoods, consisting of hundreds of houses, arrived here instantly.
As Linda Chapin, suddenly reverting to optimism, puts it: Just because we've ruined 90 percent of everything doesn't mean we can't do wonderful things with the remaining ten percent! You can see Orlando's sprawl from outer space. Go to Cypress Creek High and Meadow Woods Middle School, and you see the human complexity in the eyes of its students.

Back in the 1990s, when a real estate company was having trouble selling property in a development called Buenaventura Lakes, their marketing department decided to advertise in Spanish in the major newspapers in Puerto Rico.

Today Epcot offers a nostalgic pastiche of a 1940s seashore vacation 60 miles (97 kilometers) from the nearest sea, along with food options themed to places like Gay Paree, a space ride, and Key West time- share options.
But in Orlando, as everywhere else he roamed, Kerouac never did find escape. Florida became for him, after he stopped writing, a place to drink, and ultimately a place to die. The little house at 1418 Clouser Avenue where Kerouac wrote his novel now serves as a kind of literary time- share, where writers spend three months at a stint, hoping to channel Kerouac's manic genius. Things did not turn out as Walt Disney intended either. People thronged to the Magic Kingdom to see with their own eyes what they'd seen on TV, but Epcot, Disney's cherished project of creating a futuristic community where people lived and worked in high-tech harmony, never became a reality.

As a people, and as a nation, are we more like Disney's smiling characters? Or do we more resemble half- lost wanderers, like Kerouac and his crew?
Disney acted out the old American idea that if you can just grab hold of enough American wilderness, you can create a world free of the problems that besiege people in places like the frost belt. Kerouac evoked a rootless America where, no matter how far people wander, they never reach their destination. Never were two men so totally American and so totally different, yet both of them wound up in Orlando.

As a people, and as a nation, are we more like Disney's smiling characters? Or do we more resemble half- lost wanderers, like Kerouac and his crew? The answer seems clear: Around the world, Orlando is synonymous with the theme-park culture that has overtaken America.

The Catherine Palace, built by Catherine the Great (r. 1762-1796) in the town of Tsarskoye Selo near St. Petersburg, was the summer residence of the tsars.

Instead, the gospel according to Disney is an optimistic message of self-fulfillment, of wanting something so badly that your dreams really do come true. Orange County no longer produces oranges. Frost, disease, and development have destroyed the groves.
For some reason the truck with the graceful Chinese writing on it reminds me of the lyrics of that old Disney theme song:When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you.

Frost, disease, and development have destroyed the groves. What happens to the land once it stops producing what the juice ads once called liquid sunshine? One day I visit a former orange grove that is now named Isleworth. People pay so much to get into Isleworth because here too they are buying admission tickets to a dream.

At Cypress Creek and Meadow Woods, great events are not just things these kids and their teachers see on TV. They impinge on people's lives.

The Romanovs definitely believed in him, and he wielded powerful influence over the royal family, especially Alexandra. Healing Hopes When Rasputin first met the Romanovs in 1905, the tsarina was desperate. The 1905 revolution had almost seen the monarchy overthrown.

Wherever people neglect to mow the grass, or curse the car payments, you're in Kerouac's Orlando because they, like him, were once from someplace else. And, for a while at least, Orlando seemed to them, as it did to the Beat apostle, like a place where the utility bills never get past due and the past can never haunt you. Why not come to Orlando and dig the crazy Florida scene of spotlessly clean highways and fantastic supermarkets? Kerouac wrote Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the Beat poet, in 1961. But in Orlando, as everywhere else he roamed, Kerouac never did find escape. Florida became for him, after he stopped writing, a place to drink, and ultimately a place to die.

Losses on the front and Rasputin’s conduct at home turned the Russian people against their tsar and his family. The time was ripe for revolution. Life in Captivity For the Bolsheviks, once they took power in November 1917, the Romanovs simultaneously became a bargaining chip and a headache. Russia needed to negotiate its exit from World WarI while also avoiding a foreign invasion. The country’s enemies would be watching what happened to the former rulers, but if the Romanovs remained alive they would forever be a symbol for the monarchist movement.

Life in Captivity For the Bolsheviks, once they took power in November 1917, the Romanovs simultaneously became a bargaining chip and a headache. Russia needed to negotiate its exit from World WarI while also avoiding a foreign invasion. The country’s enemies would be watching what happened to the former rulers, but if the Romanovs remained alive they would forever be a symbol for the monarchist movement. Some wanted them sent into exile, some wanted them put on trial for their perceived crimes, and some wanted them to disappear, for good. At first the family was sent to the palace at Tsarskoye Selo. Security concerns then sent them to Tobol’sk, east of the Ural Mountains.

Orlando shows us that, despite our American urge to construct utopias, the real wonderland remains our diversity and unpredictability. At Cypress Creek High School, one student told me: I found beauty in Kissimmee. Eric Strunz, a senior at the time, was a pilgrim lost in a spiritual desert when he found it. A Buddhist temple, right there in Kissimmee, Eric said. I took off my shoes and went inside. I loved the calm, the serenity. It changed my life. I realized for the first time there were other ways of understanding the world.

The Last Days The last civilians to see the Romanovs alive were four women who had been brought in from the town to clean the Ipatiev House. Mariya Starodumova, Evdokiya Semenova, Varvara Dryagina, and an unidentified fourth gave the family a small amount of relief from the boredom of their confinement, and one final contact with the outside world. The testimony of these women has given the most penetrating and humane portrait of the doomed family. Forbidden to speak to the Romanovs, the cleaners nevertheless had the chance to observe them at close quarters.

No dumbing down is going on here. At the middle school, kids are studying things I never learned in all my years of schooling: how to conduct a symphony, how blood circulates, how to fix a faucet, how to solve disputes openly and nonviolently.

On this morning, it is cold, so cold I turn the car heater to high—though at most times of year it is stultifyingly hot. Ahead of me is an overpass, and just to complete the refutation of Orlando's all-American self- image, a big semi lunges across the overpass. Lucky Noodles, giant red characters proclaim, both in English and Chinese; it is carrying supplies for Orlando's Asian supermarkets. For some reason the truck with the graceful Chinese writing on it reminds me of the lyrics of that old Disney theme song:When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you.

Walt Disney was silent on the subject of religion; there is scarcely a mention of God in his more than 40 animated movies and none of his theme parks includes a church. Instead, the gospel according to Disney is an optimistic message of self-fulfillment, of wanting something so badly that your dreams really do come true.

With revolution at home and catastrophic failure in the First World War abroad, the Romanov dynasty, which had celebrated its third century in power in 1913, came to a swift end. Bolshevik forces held the Romanov family as prisoners, moving from place to place until one bloody night in July 1918. The entire family was wiped out, victims to a fate that they refused to see coming.

In the words of Evdokiya Semenova, they were not gods. They were actually ordinary people like us. Simple mortals. On the night of July 16, a telegram was sent to Moscow informing Lenin of the decision to carry out the murders. Rousing the family and the four servants from bed at 1:30 a. m. , Yurovsky informed them that fighting between Red and White forces was threatening the city and that they must be moved down to the basement for their own safety. Yekaterinburg-born geologist Alexander Avdonin teamed up with Russian filmmaker Geli Ryabov in the 1970s to find the burial place of the seven Romanovs. Because of his previous employment with the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ryabov was able to access classified documents that contained valuable clues.

If your heart is in your dream, the song goes on to allege, No request is too extreme. Walt Disney was silent on the subject of religion; there is scarcely a mention of God in his more than 40 animated movies and none of his theme parks includes a church.
The irony of Orlando is that people go there in search of Disneyesque tranquillity—and by doing so, they've unleashed upon the place all the rootless, restless contradictions of America. Here is big city traffic, big city crime, yet people in Orlando cherish the idea that they have escaped the trials people face in other cities. On this morning, it is cold, so cold I turn the car heater to high—though at most times of year it is stultifyingly hot. Ahead of me is an overpass, and just to complete the refutation of Orlando's all-American self- image, a big semi lunges across the overpass.

Few tourists realize it, but when their kids hug Goofy and Minnie they might be embracing low-wage workers from places like Sri Lanka and the Dominican Republic. Some complain the newcomers from developing countries aren't real Americans. Others complain the newcomers from up north aren't real Floridians.

In such a situation of psychological rootlessness and moral detachment, the question isn't whether the problems arising from unchecked growth can be solved.

While she was head of the county commission, she played a major role in unleashing Orlando's nonstop building boom.

Their team, working secretly, was able to locate the structure and in May 1979 uncovered a grave. Fearful of Soviet reprisals, they decided to keep their discovery quiet.

People thronged to the Magic Kingdom to see with their own eyes what they'd seen on TV, but Epcot, Disney's cherished project of creating a futuristic community where people lived and worked in high-tech harmony, never became a reality.

By trying to create a Magic Kingdom immune from squalor and complexity, Disney touched off an orgy of uncontrolled growth that still shows no signs of abating. Extinct theme parks litter the Orlando landscape the way dead factories mark the rust belt. Defunct attractions like Splendid China, which featured a miniature Great Wall, went bankrupt because they were too realistic. They failed to provide what all successful theme parks must: fantasies conforming exactly to what the paying public expects to get. Today Orlando is a cauldron of all the communal characteristics Disney sought to control. In its Parramore district, you can stock up on crack, meth, and angel dust. According to the Morgan Quitno research firm, in 2006 it joined such cities as Detroit and St. Louis to become one of the 25 most dangerous cities in America. The result is armed guards at the gates of communities where entry is solely by invitation. The Orlando area also has one of the highest pedestrian death rates among the largest metro regions in the country.

Four decades after Disney's fateful flyover, Orlando is a place of enormous vitality, diversity, ugliness, discord, inventiveness, possibility, and disappointed hopes, where no clown in a character costume can tell people how to live, let alone where to park.

The family fondly nicknamed the older daughters Olga and Tatiana the Big Pair, and the younger sisters Maria and Anastasia, the Little Pair. All of the family, especially Alexandra, doted on the youngest child, Alexei. The heir to the throne was born with hemophilia, which came from Alexandra’s side of the family.

Sigmund Freud once remarked that a family tends to organize itself around its most damaged member. For the Romanovs that could have been Alexandra.

And, for a while at least, Orlando seemed to them, as it did to the Beat apostle, like a place where the utility bills never get past due and the past can never haunt you. Why not come to Orlando and dig the crazy Florida scene of spotlessly clean highways and fantastic supermarkets? Kerouac wrote Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the Beat poet, in 1961. But in Orlando, as everywhere else he roamed, Kerouac never did find escape. Florida became for him, after he stopped writing, a place to drink, and ultimately a place to die. The little house at 1418 Clouser Avenue where Kerouac wrote his novel now serves as a kind of literary time- share, where writers spend three months at a stint, hoping to channel Kerouac's manic genius. Things did not turn out as Walt Disney intended either. People thronged to the Magic Kingdom to see with their own eyes what they'd seen on TV, but Epcot, Disney's cherished project of creating a futuristic community where people lived and worked in high-tech harmony, never became a reality.
