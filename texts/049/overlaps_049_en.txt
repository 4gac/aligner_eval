An old man stood outside the Bishop’s Palace selling stale bread for the birds. They bought some and stood at the water’s edge feeding five cygnets whose feathers were turning white. Brown ducks flew across the water and landed in a nice skim on the moat. When a black Labrador came bounding down the path, a huddle of pigeons rose as one and settled magically in the trees. I feel like Francis of Assisi, she laughed. Rain began to fall; she felt it falling on her face like small electric shocks.

And at the same time she was saying, "It’s all right, I forgive you.” John says that it was vital for him to meet face to face with Kim, and to tell her that he had agonized for years over her injuries.

Pat, another Vietnam veteran, is a gentle, quiet man who loves children and horses. In the seven years since I first met him, however, I have become aware that he has a darker side – one that centers on his inability to forgive himself: Death is on my mind a lot.

That weekend she was determined to find out. It was December; she felt a curtain closing on another year. On Friday evening, she took the train into the city, sat reading in a first-class carriage. The crime novel didn’t hold her interest; she could already predict the ending. She had left a dish of macaroni cheese out for the kids, brought her husbandas suits back from the cleaners. When she reached the city she took a taxi to the hotel. They gave her a small, white room with a view of Vicar’s Close, one of the oldest streets in England, a row of stone houses with tall, granite chimneys where the clergy lived. She sat at the hotel bar that night nursing a tequila and lime, but there was nothing doing. Old men were reading newspapers, business was slow, but she didn’t mind; she needed a good night’s sleep. She fell into her rented bed, into a dreamless sleep, and woke to the sound of bells ringing in the cathedral.
The air spiked her lungs.
The air spiked her lungs. Clouds smashed into each other in the sky.

An old man stood outside the Bishop’s Palace selling stale bread for the birds.

I feel like Francis of Assisi, she laughed.
