in the 15 (other) since that dramatic (other) brugger and others have come a long way towards (other) out of body experiences (empty)
they have (other) down the cause to (other) in a (other) brain (other) and are now working out how these lead to the almost (other) experience of (other) your own body and (other) it from (other) (empty)
they are also using out of body experiences to (other) a long standing (other) how we create and maintain a sense of self (empty)

it is clear though that people with no (other) neurological disorders can have an out of body experience (empty)
by some estimates about (other) percent of healthy people have one at some point in their lives (empty)
so what (other) is an out of body experience (empty)
a definition has recently emerged that (other) a (other) of increasingly bizarre (other) (empty)
the least severe of these is a doppelgänger experience your sense the presence of or see a person you know to be yourself though you remain (other) in your own body (empty)
this often (other) to stage 2 where your sense of self (other) back and (other) between your real body and your doppelgänger (empty)

some out of body experiences (other) just one of these stages some all (other) in (other) (empty)
(other) many people who have one (other) it as a pleasant experience (empty)
so what could be going on in the brain to create such a seemingly (other) sensation (empty)

they were (other) (other) brain surgery on a (other) year old woman with severe epilepsy to (other) which part of her brain to (other) in order to (other) her (empty)
when they (other) a (other) near the back of the brain called the (other) (other) tpj the woman reported that she was floating above from her own body and (other) down on herself (empty)
this (other) some kind of neurological sense (empty)

sure enough the team found that tpj was activated during the experiences (empty)
(other) from neurological disorders or brain surgery can only (other) you so (other) however not least because cases are rare (empty)
larger scale studies are required and to (other) this blanke and others have used a technique called own body transformation tasks to force the brain to do things that is seemingly does during an out of body experience (empty)
in these experiments subjects are shown a (other) of (other) (other) of cartoon figures (other) a glove on one hand (empty)

to do this you may have to mentally rotate you own body as one image (other) another (empty)
as volunteers (other) these tasks the researches (other) their brain activity with an eeg and found that the tpj was activated when the volunteers (other) themselves in a position different from their (other) (other) – an out of body position (empty)

other brain regions have been (other) too including (other) close to the tpj (empty)
the (other) (other) is that when these regions are working (other) we feel at one with our body (empty)
but (other) them and our sense of embodiment can (other) (other) (empty)
this does not however (other) the most striking feature of out of body experiences (empty)
it's a great (other) why people from their out of body (other) visualise not only their bodies but things around them such as other people says brugger (empty)
where does this information come from (empty)
one line of evidence (other) from the condition known as sleep paralysis in which healthy people find their body (other) as in sleep despite being conscious see the (other) (other) (empty)
in a (other) of (other) (other) (other) people who had experienced sleep paralysis (other) cheyne of the university of (other) in (other) canada found that many reported sensations similar to out of body experiences (empty)
these (other) floating of of their body and (other) back to look at it (empty)
cheyne suggests that this might be the (other) of conflicts of information in the brain (empty)
during sleep paralysis it is (other) to enter a rem like state in which you dream of (other) or (other) (empty)
under these circumstances you are conscious of a sensation of movement yet your brain is aware that your body cannot move (empty)
in an (other) to (other) this sensory conflict the brain (other) the sense of self (other) cortex vol (other) p (other) (empty)
it (other) by (other) the self from its body says cheyne (empty)
