After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Great Britain, the foremost colonial power of the time, mounted a series of Arctic expeditions to reach the Bering Strait by crossing the Arctic, which was at the time believed to be an open sea surrounded by a belt of ice. Sir John Ross and Sir William Edward Parry led several expeditions in the 1820s and 30s, but none located the passage itself. In 1831 a scientific milestone was achieved by James Clark Ross, nephew of John and an officer on his uncle’s Arctic voyage of 1829-1832. While on a sledge excursion, the young Ross became the first European to locate the planet’s north magnetic pole. This unimpressive sign marks the 90° north latitude. The sign itself shifts as the polar caps are dragged along by the powerful marine currents. AKG/ALBUMThese early voyages revealed how dangerous exploration of northern waters could be but whetted explorers’ appetite for discovery. Complications often arose from frigid waters trapping ships in newly forming ice. If a crew could not free their vessel, they often had to wait for months—either for a rescue or for the ice to thaw enough for them to sail away. In May 1845 another British expedition launched to find the Northwest Passage.

He then asked each couple to stare into each other‘s eyes for two minutes. After this encounter, Aron found most of the couples, previously strangers to each other, reported feelings of attraction. In fact, one couple went on to marry. Fisher says this exercise works wonders for some couples. Aron and Fisher also suggest doing novel things together, because novelty triggers dopamine in the brain, which can stimulate feelings of attraction.

Carrying this a step further, Aron and others have found that even if you just jog in place and then meet someone, you‘re more likely to think they‘re attractive.

Assuming a fairly healthy relationship, if you have enough orgasms with your partner, you may become attached to him or her. You will stimulate oxytocin. It‘s exactly what your mother always said about vegetables: Keep eating your peas.

One of their ships made it some 1, 250 miles, but the crew had to abandon the mission and were rescued by a whaling ship. The Grinnell expeditions had small successes: One of Franklin’s wintering camps was identified on Beechey Island, but searchers found nothing else that revealed Franklin’s fate.
Captain Inglefield's ship Isabel sailed in Arctic waters in 1852, as depicted by George Chambers. British explorer Edward Inglefield captained the Isabel in 1852 into Smith Sound, the channel separating the islands of Greenland and Ellesmere (Canada) which until then had been believed impassable. By the time the ice forced him to turn around at 78° north latitude, he had pushed farther into the strait than anyone before him. The search for Franklin’s ships and the North Pole also caught the imaginations of several American explorers.

Around this time, German explorers also began seeking the North Pole after prominent geographer August Petermann called for them to get involved in the quest.
Each expedition faced a relentless battle against cold, exhaustion, and ultimately, ice. One of their ships made it some 1, 250 miles, but the crew had to abandon the mission and were rescued by a whaling ship. The Grinnell expeditions had small successes: One of Franklin’s wintering camps was identified on Beechey Island, but searchers found nothing else that revealed Franklin’s fate. They charted nearly 1, 000 miles of unexplored coastline. In 1860, aboard the ship United States, Isaac Israel Hayes, a physician and explorer who had served on the second Grinnell mission, set out to reach the North Pole via Baffin Bay and Smith Sound.

In India romantic love has traditionally been seen as dangerous, a threat to a well-crafted caste system in which marriages are arranged as a means of preserving lineage and bloodlines.

A few intrepid explorers—John Cabot, Martin Frobisher, Henry Hudson, and James Cook—tried to navigate the region in search of the Northwest Passage, a sea route believed to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the waters above North America. The North Pole was not a concern for these early explorers, but their work laid the foundation for a polar obsession to come. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Great Britain, the foremost colonial power of the time, mounted a series of Arctic expeditions to reach the Bering Strait by crossing the Arctic, which was at the time believed to be an open sea surrounded by a belt of ice. Sir John Ross and Sir William Edward Parry led several expeditions in the 1820s and 30s, but none located the passage itself. In 1831 a scientific milestone was achieved by James Clark Ross, nephew of John and an officer on his uncle’s Arctic voyage of 1829-1832. While on a sledge excursion, the young Ross became the first European to locate the planet’s north magnetic pole.

His book The Open Polar Sea, published in 1867, captured American imaginations and provided details about the harsh conditions faced in the Arctic and the resourcefulness of the Inuit whom he encountered there. Around this time, German explorers also began seeking the North Pole after prominent geographer August Petermann called for them to get involved in the quest.

In 1852 Captain Edward Inglefield was in charge of one of the ships involved in the search for the missing explorers, and "We were entering the Polar Sea, and wild thoughts of getting to the Pole rushed rapidly through my brain.” He didn’t find the lost ships, nor did he reach the pole—the ice in the Smith Sound blocked his way—but Inglefield did say that he had seen clear waters just a short distance north. Captain Inglefield's ship Isabel sailed in Arctic waters in 1852, as depicted by George Chambers. British explorer Edward Inglefield captained the Isabel in 1852 into Smith Sound, the channel separating the islands of Greenland and Ellesmere (Canada) which until then had been believed impassable. By the time the ice forced him to turn around at 78° north latitude, he had pushed farther into the strait than anyone before him. The search for Franklin’s ships and the North Pole also caught the imaginations of several American explorers. In the 1850s American financier Henry Grinnell backed two expeditions to locate Franklin’s ships and any potential survivors.

In England, Franklin’s expedition, the tragic fate of which was eventually discovered in 1859, led to a public ambivalence toward North Pole expeditions, but the British Navy still sought the prize.

In 1852 Captain Edward Inglefield was in charge of one of the ships involved in the search for the missing explorers, and "We were entering the Polar Sea, and wild thoughts of getting to the Pole rushed rapidly through my brain.” He didn’t find the lost ships, nor did he reach the pole—the ice in the Smith Sound blocked his way—but Inglefield did say that he had seen clear waters just a short distance north.
In May 1845 another British expedition launched to find the Northwest Passage. Led by celebrated British explorer and naval officer Sir John Franklin, a crew of 133 sailed the H. M. S. Erebus and H. M. S. Terror into Arctic waters and disappeared without a trace. Over the next decade more than a hundred European ships went looking for Franklin and his men, searching the labyrinth of islands and inlets that make up the Canadian Arctic. These rescue missions weren’t successful in finding Franklin (his two ships would not be found until 2014 and 2016), but they did have unexpected results.

While on a sledge excursion, the young Ross became the first European to locate the planet’s north magnetic pole.

In England, Franklin’s expedition, the tragic fate of which was eventually discovered in 1859, led to a public ambivalence toward North Pole expeditions, but the British Navy still sought the prize.

Later on, at home, I tell my friends what we learned at Kissing School: We don‘t have time to kiss. A perfectly typical marriage. Love in the Western world. Luckily I‘ve learned of other options for restarting love. Arthur Aron, a psychologist at Stony Brook University in New York, conducted an experiment that illuminates some of the mechanisms by which people become and stay attracted. He recruited a group of men and women and put opposite sex pairs in rooms together, instructing each pair to perform a series of tasks, which included telling each other personal details about themselves. He then asked each couple to stare into each other‘s eyes for two minutes. After this encounter, Aron found most of the couples, previously strangers to each other, reported feelings of attraction. In fact, one couple went on to marry.

Led by celebrated British explorer and naval officer Sir John Franklin, a crew of 133 sailed the H. M. S. Erebus and H. M. S. Terror into Arctic waters and disappeared without a trace. Over the next decade more than a hundred European ships went looking for Franklin and his men, searching the labyrinth of islands and inlets that make up the Canadian Arctic.

Over the next decade more than a hundred European ships went looking for Franklin and his men, searching the labyrinth of islands and inlets that make up the Canadian Arctic. These rescue missions weren’t successful in finding Franklin (his two ships would not be found until 2014 and 2016), but they did have unexpected results.

Renu hoped to fall in love with her husband, but the more years that passed, the less love she felt, until, at the end, she was shrunken, bitter, hiding behind the curtains of her in-laws‘ bungalow, looking with longing at the couple on the balcony across from theirs. It was so obvious to me that couple had married for love, and I envied them.

In two months of trudging, exhausted, over the ice, they only managed to advance 10 miles. Fortunately, the expedition did finally make it back to the open sea and reached the Russian coast, where they were rescued by a fisherman.

It was so obvious to me that couple had married for love, and I envied them. I really did. It hurt me so much to see how they stood together, how they went shopping for bread and eggs. Exhausted from being forced into confinement, from being swaddled in saris that made it difficult to move, from resisting the pressure to eat off her husband‘s plate, Renu did what traditional Indian culture forbids one to do. She left. By this time she had had two children. She took them with her. In her mind was an old movie she‘d seen on TV, a movie so strange and enticing to her, so utterly confounding and comforting at the same time, that she couldn‘t get it out of her head.

Renu was lucky in the end.
Renu was lucky in the end. In Mumbai she met a man named Anil, and it was then, for the first time, that she felt passion.

In long-term relationships that never get off the ground, like Renu and her first husband‘s, or that crumble once the high is gone, chances are the couple has not found a way to stimulate or sustain oxytocin production.

But there are things you can do to help it along, says Helen Fisher. Massage. Make love. These things trigger oxytocin and thus make you feel much closer to your partner.
Scientists have been experimenting by treating autistic people with oxytocin, which in some cases has helped alleviate their symptoms.

While on a sledge excursion, the young Ross became the first European to locate the planet’s north magnetic pole. This unimpressive sign marks the 90° north latitude. The sign itself shifts as the polar caps are dragged along by the powerful marine currents. AKG/ALBUMThese early voyages revealed how dangerous exploration of northern waters could be but whetted explorers’ appetite for discovery. Complications often arose from frigid waters trapping ships in newly forming ice. If a crew could not free their vessel, they often had to wait for months—either for a rescue or for the ice to thaw enough for them to sail away. In May 1845 another British expedition launched to find the Northwest Passage.

As a scientist, my husband is always up for an experiment. But our lives are so busy that, in order to do this, we have to make a plan.
The British public felt the mission was a disaster for having failed to reach the Pole and resulting in the deaths of so many men.
The Discovery stopped and set up winter quarters at Lady Franklin Bay off Hall Basin, while the Alert sailed farther north and sheltered in a bay near Ellesmere Island.

To date, it was the farthest point north reached by a European ship. At this point, Nares began having second thoughts about the expedition. His observations led him to believe there was no open polar sea. Despite his misgivings, the mission continued. After wintering in their respective spots, both crews sent out several sledging parties to explore the terrain in the spring. It turned out that they were poorly equipped for the brutal Arctic conditions. They were able to go as far as 83° 20'—the farthest any Western explorer had reached so far.

The Grinnell expeditions had small successes: One of Franklin’s wintering camps was identified on Beechey Island, but searchers found nothing else that revealed Franklin’s fate. They charted nearly 1, 000 miles of unexplored coastline. In 1860, aboard the ship United States, Isaac Israel Hayes, a physician and explorer who had served on the second Grinnell mission, set out to reach the North Pole via Baffin Bay and Smith Sound. Hayes claimed to have traveled far north enough to have seen the open polar sea, but later analysis revealed that his calculations were off.
The search for Franklin’s ships and the North Pole also caught the imaginations of several American explorers. In the 1850s American financier Henry Grinnell backed two expeditions to locate Franklin’s ships and any potential survivors.

Their relationship, once so full of fire, now seems to simmer along at an even temperature, enough to keep them well fed and warm. They are grateful. Would I want all that passion back? Renu asks. Sometimes, yes. But to tell you the truth, it was exhausting. From a physiological point of view, this couple has moved from the dopamine-drenched state of romantic love to the relative quiet of an oxytocin-induced attachment.

With two kids, two cats, two dogs, a lopsided house, and a questionable school system, we may know how to kiss, but in the rough and tumble of our harried lives we have indeed forgotten how to kiss. The sky is paved with clouds, the air as sticky as jam in our hands and on our necks. The Kissing School, run by Cherie Byrd, a therapist from Seattle, is being held on the 12th floor of a run-down building in Manhattan. Inside, the room is whitewashed; a tiled table holds bottles of banana and apricot nectar, a pot of green tea, breath mints, and Chapstick.

Yet most Indians still believe arranged marriages are more likely to succeed than love marriages. In one survey of Indian college students, 76 percent said they‘d marry someone with all the right qualities even if they weren‘t in love with the person (compared with only 14 percent of Americans).
To the Fulbe tribe of northern Cameroon, poise matters more than passion. Men who spend too much time with their wives are taunted, and those who are weak-kneed are thought to have fallen under a dangerous spell. Love may be inevitable, but for the Fulbe its manifestations are shameful, equated with sickness and social impairment. In India romantic love has traditionally been seen as dangerous, a threat to a well-crafted caste system in which marriages are arranged as a means of preserving lineage and bloodlines.

When I first met Anil, it was like nothing I‘d ever experienced. He was the first man I ever had an orgasm with. I was high, just high, all the time.

But there are things you can do to help it along, says Helen Fisher. Massage. Make love. These things trigger oxytocin and thus make you feel much closer to your partner. Well, I suppose that‘s good advice, but it‘s based on the assumption that you still want to have sex with that boring windbag of a husband.

Renu lives in a well- appointed apartment in this thronging city, where cows sleep on the highways as tiny cars whiz around them, plumes of black smoke rising from their sooty pipes.
