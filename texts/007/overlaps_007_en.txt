The first era of marketing was mass marketing—the dawn of advertising as we know it, where average products were repeatedly advertised to the largest possible number of average people, using mass communication methods, particularly television. Anyone who has seen the TV series Mad Men will have some insight into those heady days of the first ad agencies. The second phase was direct marketing—a far more focused approach of segmenting and targeting a particular market, creating marketing lists, and then bombarding them with junk mail (er, I mean direct mail). While more targeted, this is still an interruption of people’s attention. We are now in the era of social marketing. We can still reach targeted markets—even more niche than before, in fact—but the difference now is that we are not so much interrupting them, or even seeking permission to communicate with them, as creating communities around our products and services. We are making ourselves findable by these communities so that, instead of having to find, target and mail them, they come looking for us! How did this come about?

Anyone who has seen the TV series Mad Men will have some insight into those heady days of the first ad agencies.

The new marketing isn’t austerity marketing. But it does also have advantages when funds are tight.

You might think of it as permission-based marketing, word-of-mouth marketing, or conversational marketing.
