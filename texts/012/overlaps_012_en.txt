He was the one who used to shout 'Make a corridor' if someone was ill at the front of the crowd and needed to be carried to the back, until the phrase became a catch-cry.
An American couple working as volunteers in a local bank told us how Prague was full of Americans now, Bratislava was a much better place to be if you want to mix in the society. At the first hints of twilight a couple came to collect their son who had been playing in the garden. They were different from the rest, taller, much more glamorous, a bit older; even when they didn't talk - and the man said nothing most of the time, merely watched everything and smiled - they appeared to be the centre of things. I wondered who they were and what they did. He looked like someone I had seen on television. He was in his early forties and dressed in black; his wife was elegant with long blonde hair.

Disney chose Orlando because it was at the confluence of two of the most important of these new thoroughfares, what today are Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike. There was also a deeply personal reason he located Disney World there—the same one that still lures people to Orlando today. In Florida's boggy, buggy, empty midsection, Walt Disney perceived a second chance. His original theme park—Disneyland, in southern California—covered fewer than 300 acres (120 hectares).
Disney realized that in the coming decades shows like The Mickey Mouse Club, not climate and geology, would determine what the majority of Americans would consider a safe and enjoyable place to take a family vacation.

Orlando's developers, like the producers of instant coffee, offer you a variety of flavors, including one called Tradition. Structurally it may seem identical to all the others. In Orlando's lively downtown, it's possible to live in a loft just as you would in Chicago or New York. But these lofts are brand-new buildings constructed for those who want the postindustrial lifestyle in a place that never was industrial. Orlando's bright lights are not the garish displays of Las Vegas or the proud power logos of New York.

This, truly, is a 21st-century paradigm: It is growth built on consumption, not production; a society founded not on natural resources, but upon the dissipation of capital accumulated elsewhere; a place of infinite possibilities, somehow held together, to the extent it is held together at all, by a shared recognition of highway signs, brand names, TV shows, and personalities, rather than any shared history. Nowhere else is the juxtaposition of what America actually is and the conventional idea of what America should be more vivid and revealing. Welcome to the theme-park nation. I fell in love with the sense of potential, says Rick Tesch, one of modern Orlando's boosters. I saw Orlando as a great place to be, globally. Tesch could be talking about franchising car rental agencies. Instead, he is talking about religion.

And he was in power in the days after the revolution, and lost power in the intricate political machinations in Bratislava in 1990 and 1991, but there was talk now that he might return to politics, no one knew. I thought of how hard it must be to have known those days when you could lead your country, hold the crowd, realising that the days would never come back, that afterwards everything would be dull and distant. People who get a taste of power always find it hard to do without it. He asked me what I was writing about. Catholic Europe,' I said. I'm Lutheran,' he replied and smiled, as if to say that he was sorry he could not be any use to me.

In the 1980s, Orlando's civic elite had decided it could be a leader in faith as well as theme parks. For Tesch, a devout man working for the Orlando Economic Development Commission at the time, the opportunity to lure religious organizations to the Orlando area was a privilege as well as a challenge.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

People dropped in for a while, had a drink and left, and then others came. Juraj and Tana went to do some work, but I stayed on. Everyone was bright and well-dressed and thirtysomething. The food was good, and the air was warm enough for us to sit out on the veranda, even though the sky was full of pale, low cloud. An American couple working as volunteers in a local bank told us how Prague was full of Americans now, Bratislava was a much better place to be if you want to mix in the society. At the first hints of twilight a couple came to collect their son who had been playing in the garden. They were different from the rest, taller, much more glamorous, a bit older; even when they didn't talk - and the man said nothing most of the time, merely watched everything and smiled - they appeared to be the centre of things.

I wondered who they were and what they did.
I thought of how hard it must be to have known those days when you could lead your country, hold the crowd, realising that the days would never come back, that afterwards everything would be dull and distant.
I thought of how hard it must be to have known those days when you could lead your country, hold the crowd, realising that the days would never come back, that afterwards everything would be dull and distant. People who get a taste of power always find it hard to do without it.

As they collected their son, it struck me that they were going home and would not go out again, but would sit in tonight: something a politician would never have to do.

I told her how amazed I had been by Carnogursky's response to the question about the war years and the quisling Slovak state. She shook her head and said that no one in Bratislava now knew much about the period; they were not sure what was communist propaganda and what was truth.

In the process, Henry, who's now retired as pastor, has become an authority on megachurch growth management. His book Dangerous Intersections shows churches how to cope with their growth.
I wanted us to move to where the new center of Orlando was going to be, he says. When the group found a parcel of 160 acres (65 hectares) located near the intersection of two freeways, offering access to both Disney World and the airport, Henry knew First Baptist had found its promised land. Today the church offers the same assemblage of green space, ample parking, and low-slung buildings you find in Orlando's better commercial parks and residential developments.

As Henry explains it, one of the trickiest things about getting people to worship is getting them in and out of the parking lots.

I was ready to go home now, wandering around, killing time before my train was due to leave. In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

There was thus no great square in front of the cathedral, and there was no easy access to the old quarter or the Jewish quarter across the motorway.

The mouse is Mickey, the man Walt Disney. If it weren't for Disney, the local saying goes, the Orlando region would be called Ocala, a rival town up the road.

It was strange standing here, having been so close all afternoon without knowing that there was a grotto nearby. As we walked back up the steps to the road I could hear shouting in the distance, as though there was a football match going on. Tana said it was a bar. It was still open.

It was cold now and the party was breaking up. Tana and I agreed to walk into the city, but as we left I noticed a sort of quarry in front of the house.

And he was in power in the days after the revolution, and lost power in the intricate political machinations in Bratislava in 1990 and 1991, but there was talk now that he might return to politics, no one knew. I thought of how hard it must be to have known those days when you could lead your country, hold the crowd, realising that the days would never come back, that afterwards everything would be dull and distant. People who get a taste of power always find it hard to do without it. He asked me what I was writing about.

Kerouac's tumultuous vision was a howling rant against the plastic shackles he perceived imprisoning the human spirit in mid-century America.

Juraj and Tana went to do some work, but I stayed on. Everyone was bright and well-dressed and thirtysomething. The food was good, and the air was warm enough for us to sit out on the veranda, even though the sky was full of pale, low cloud.

An American couple working as volunteers in a local bank told us how Prague was full of Americans now, Bratislava was a much better place to be if you want to mix in the society.

Juraj had told me how much the city had been destroyed by a motorway cut through the old quarter. The new road had barely spared the cathedral, almost grazing it as it sped past. There was thus no great square in front of the cathedral, and there was no easy access to the old quarter or the Jewish quarter across the motorway.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

That day, flying over central Florida, Disney decided that he, not reality, would define what constituted the Magic Kingdom in the minds and spending habits of millions of Americans in the years to come. The interstate highway system, started by the Eisenhower Administration as part of the Cold War defense effort against communism, was already crisscrossing America.

The megachurch is the culmination, at least so far, of the integration of religious practice into the freeway-driven, market-savvy, franchise form of American life. The emergence of Orlando's largest megachurch, the First Baptist Church, from a small congregation into a powerful, wealthy organization, parallels Orlando's own transformation.

That's it, Disney proclaimed, pointing down to the future site of what he dreamed of creating in this Florida wilderness: Epcot, America's Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. Over the next two years, with the collusion of Orlando's top leaders, Disney secretly acquired more than 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares).

Today dozens of megachurches and religious organizations, many with multimillion-dollar budgets, are located in the area. The megachurch is the culmination, at least so far, of the integration of religious practice into the freeway-driven, market-savvy, franchise form of American life. The emergence of Orlando's largest megachurch, the First Baptist Church, from a small congregation into a powerful, wealthy organization, parallels Orlando's own transformation. The turning point came, as in many Orlando stories, when a sense of mission intersected with a real estate opportunity.

The beer was strong, Tana said, it made you drunk easily. It was freezing now that darkness had fallen, but this put none of the drinkers off. We had beers and tried to talk despite the terrible, loud singing coming from the other tables. I was not entirely sure that this scene and the scene at the grotto with the woman praying in the shadow of the tree were not from a dream, or a movie, or something imagined. But the cold was real.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945.

In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945. The books looked dogeared and badly produced; they were cheap. Two elderly women sat on chairs beside the stall, a few men stood behind them. They watched as the crowds streamed out of the church. No one paid any attention to them, no one stopped at the stall, or bought their books. They had the air of people who belonged to an old world, a time gone by.

Kerouac's tumultuous vision was a howling rant against the plastic shackles he perceived imprisoning the human spirit in mid-century America. Looking out his window at the neighbors, he scorned the middle-class non-identity which finds its perfect expression … in rows of well-to-do houses with lawns and television sets in each living room with everybody looking at the same thing and thinking the same thing at the same time.

They were different from the rest, taller, much more glamorous, a bit older; even when they didn't talk - and the man said nothing most of the time, merely watched everything and smiled - they appeared to be the centre of things. I wondered who they were and what they did. He looked like someone I had seen on television. He was in his early forties and dressed in black; his wife was elegant with long blonde hair. He seemed half bored, sitting there nursing a beer, as though his mind was elsewhere; he exuded a restless sort of contentment.
The food was good, and the air was warm enough for us to sit out on the veranda, even though the sky was full of pale, low cloud.

It was only when Tana returned that I learned he was Milan Knazko, the actor who had led the revolution in Bratislava, who had addressed all the meetings in November 1989, who held the crowd in the power of his presence.

At his instigation, the church formed a search committee. I told the people looking for land, 'Look 150 years ahead'. I wanted us to move to where the new center of Orlando was going to be, he says.
The turning point came, as in many Orlando stories, when a sense of mission intersected with a real estate opportunity. In the early 1980s, First Baptist's pastor, Jim Henry, believed the church should get out of Orlando's downtown. He had arrived in 1977 from rural Mississippi. I felt this town was going to take off. It had good connectedness: spiritual, business, political connectedness, he says. He foresaw that the old downtown would no longer be the epicenter of Orlando. At his instigation, the church formed a search committee. I told the people looking for land, 'Look 150 years ahead'. I wanted us to move to where the new center of Orlando was going to be, he says. When the group found a parcel of 160 acres (65 hectares) located near the intersection of two freeways, offering access to both Disney World and the airport, Henry knew First Baptist had found its promised land.

They would never have done this to Prague, I found myself thinking. I was ready to go home now, wandering around, killing time before my train was due to leave. In the city centre, near one of the old churches, as people came out of Mass, preparing to disappear once more into the hidden domestic life of the city, there was a stall selling books by and about Dr Josef Tiso, who ran Slovakia for Hider between 1939 and 1945. The books looked dogeared and badly produced; they were cheap. Two elderly women sat on chairs beside the stall, a few men stood behind them. They watched as the crowds streamed out of the church.

And on that Sunday morning, the First Sunday after Easter 1993, the works of Dr Josef Tiso did not seem to interest the people of Bratislava on their way home from Mass. Walt Disney's utopian dream forever changed Orlando, Florida, and laid the blueprint for the new American metropolis.

This, truly, is a 21st-century paradigm: It is growth built on consumption, not production; a society founded not on natural resources, but upon the dissipation of capital accumulated elsewhere; a place of infinite possibilities, somehow held together, to the extent it is held together at all, by a shared recognition of highway signs, brand names, TV shows, and personalities, rather than any shared history.

It gobbles up existing communities even as it transforms scrub and swamp into a characterless conurbation of congested freeways and parking lots. All of this is Orlando, the brand name for this region of two million residents. When people tell the story of Orlando's stunning transformation from swamp and sinkhole to 21st-century metropolis, they begin, inevitably, with the man and the mouse. The mouse is Mickey, the man Walt Disney. If it weren't for Disney, the local saying goes, the Orlando region would be called Ocala, a rival town up the road.

Who are all these people? They're you, they're me, and increasingly, they are nothing like the blue-eyed Dick and Jane of mythical suburban America. Orlando's explosion is visible in every shopping mall and traffic jam. You can also see it from outer space.

In between was darkness. Today the two parallel l's have become a lopsided H. Central Florida glows as though a phosphorescent creature from outer space has landed there and started reproducing. It gobbles up existing communities even as it transforms scrub and swamp into a characterless conurbation of congested freeways and parking lots.

There was hardly a new ranch home or split-level that didn't have a TV antenna on the roof.

Disney realized that in the coming decades shows like The Mickey Mouse Club, not climate and geology, would determine what the majority of Americans would consider a safe and enjoyable place to take a family vacation.

That day, flying over central Florida, Disney decided that he, not reality, would define what constituted the Magic Kingdom in the minds and spending habits of millions of Americans in the years to come.

Disney chose Orlando because it was at the confluence of two of the most important of these new thoroughfares, what today are Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike.

There was also a deeply personal reason he located Disney World there—the same one that still lures people to Orlando today.
