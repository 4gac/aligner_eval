how good you are (empty)
how (other) you are (empty)
there is no one in the (other) world as good and (other) as you (empty)
i will go with you to the mountains (empty)
i will (other) you to make my feet like hinds feet and to set me even me upon the high places (empty)
i am more glad even than you said the (other) and now you (other) act as though you are (other) to change your (other) (other) (empty)
but there is one thing more i must tell you (empty)
you will not see me all the time much afraid for as i (other) you i shall be (other) on the mountains and (other) on the (other) and you will not at first be able to (other) me or keep up with me (empty)
that will come later (empty)
however you must remember that as (other) as you (other) the (other) of the mountains there is a (other) system of (other) from end to end of the kingdom of love and i shall be able to hear you whenever you (other) to me (empty)

remember i have chosen them (other) with (other) (other) as the two who are most able to help you and (other) you in developing hinds feet (empty)
you will accept them with joy and allow them to be your (other) will you not (empty)
(other) (other) she (other) at once (other) at him (other) (empty)
of (other) i am (other) certain that you know best and that (other) you (other) is (other) (empty)
then she (other) (other) i (other) as though i shall never be afraid again (empty)
he (other) very (other) at the little (other) who had just (other) the seed of love into her heart and was (other) to go with him to the high places but also with (other) understanding (empty)

i shall be (other) by love made (other) as (other) to see (empty)

o (other) (other) (other) (other) (other) indeed not know (empty)
then lead my little (other) the way that my (other) go and be to me as i to thee sweet (other) (empty)
then she (other) into a (other) (other) (other) (empty)
function is (other) purpose (empty)
when we use the (other) function we are (other) that (other) has a purpose (empty)
so when we apply that term to training (other) or sports we are (other) about (other) training for sports (empty)
the idea of functional training or functional exercise actually originated in the sports (other) world (empty)
as is often the (other) the (other) and exercises used in (other) found their way from the physical therapy (other) and (other) training room into the weight room (empty)
the most basic thought was that the exercises used to (other) an athlete to health might also be the best exercises to (other) and improve health (empty)
(other) the concept of functional training was first applied to sports it has been (other) and (other) by many athletes and coaches (empty)
(other) such as sport specific which (other) that certain movements and movement patterns are specific to (other) sports have been used to (other) some functional training concepts (empty)
but sport specific training (other) place with the athlete on the (other) field or court (other) in strength and conditioning we work to (other) the athlete (other) and to improve specific conditioning (empty)
indeed functional training may be more (other) (other) by the term sports general training than by the term sport specific training (empty)
although we may (other) with the (other) (other) of sport specific (other) in this book it is important to understand that most sports (other) far more (other) than (other) (empty)
the sports general (other) of thought (other) sports as (other) far more similar than different (empty)
actions such as sprinting (other) (other) and (other) (other) are general skills that apply to a (other) (other) of sports (empty)
a sports (other) (other) that speed training for all sports is similar (empty)
fast is fast regard less of (other) we are training (other) (other) players or (other) players (empty)
in fact if you viewed our programs the first thing that would (other) you is that no (other) how different the athletes may appear the program (other) similar (empty)
to better understand the concept of functional training (other) (other) a few simple questions (empty)
how many sports are played (other) down (empty)
as far as i can tell (other) a few sports such as (other) are performed from a seated position (empty)
if we accept this (other) we can see that training muscles from a seated position would not be functional for most sports (empty)
how many sports are played in a (other) (other) (other) stability is (other) (other) by outside (other) (empty)
the answer would appear to be (other) (empty)
most sports are (other) on (other) or (other) (empty)
the stability is (other) by the athlete not by some outside (other) (empty)
although in (other) (other) based training may result in (other) injuries during training the lack of (other) (other) (other) (other) (other) about position and movement and the lack of stabilization will more than (other) lead to a (other) (other) of injuries during (other) (empty)
how many sports skills are performed by one joint acting in (other) (empty)
again the answer is (other) (empty)
functional training (other) to (other) on multijoint movement as much as (other) (empty)
(other) (other) and gary (other) two (other) (other) (other) on functional training (other) single joint movements that (other) a specific muscle are very (other) functional (empty)
(other) joint movements which (other) muscle groups into movement patterns are very functional (other) (other) (other) (empty)
from the (other) to those (other) questions we (other) (other) (other) that functional training is best (other) by exercises done with the feet in contact with the ground and with few (other) without the aid of (other) (empty)
(other) to the concept of functional training often (other) in the idea that we have always done it this way (empty)
but as (other) (other) (other) (other) in his book (other) (other) what if the way we have always done it was (other) (empty)
in (other) most basic (other) a functional training program (other) an athlete to (other) his sport (empty)
functional training is not about using one sport to train an athlete for another sport (empty)
(other) cross training (empty)
many (other) strength programs (other) the two and as a result train their athletes to be (other) and (other) style (other) as much as they do to (other) in their primary sports (empty)
functional training on the other (other) (other) many concepts (other) by sport coaches to train speed strength and power in order to improve sport (other) and reduce incidence of injury (empty)
the key in (other) those concepts from the track (other) or powerlifting (other) is to apply them (other) to athletes (empty)
they (other) be applied (other) from one sport to another (empty)
functional training (other) train speed strength and power in order to improve sport (other) (other) and reduce incidence of injury (empty)
the science behind functional training (empty)
this concept is a difficult one to accept for those who have (other) (other) (other) (other) anatomy but on (other) (other) it makes (other) sense (empty)
in the landing phase of sprinting is the quadriceps a knee (other) (empty)
no when the foot (other) the ground the quadriceps is actually (other) eccentrically to prevent knee flexion (empty)
are the hamstrings a knee (other) (empty)
the hamstrings in fact are acting in a (other) (other) to prevent both knee flexion and hip flexion (empty)
as you (other) this through the answer (other) more (other) and (other) (other) to accept (empty)
in the landing phase of walking or running all the muscles of the lower extremity act in (other) to prevent an action not to (other) one (empty)
all the muscles eccentrically by (other) (other) or (other) down flexion at the ankle knee and hip (empty)
once (other) (other) the (other) concept the (other) (other) (other) more simply (empty)
you should now understand that (other) the athlete has (other) the foot on the ground and (other) flexion all the lower extremity muscles again act as a (other) to (other) extension at the ankle knee and hip (empty)
in fact the quadriceps is not just (other) the knee but (other) with (other) flexion of the ankle and extension of the hip (empty)
when viewed through the functional anatomy (other) all the muscles act eccentrically in the first (other) to (other) a movement and then (other) later act (other) to (other) a movement (empty)
if (other) concepts (other) to make sense you are on your way to understanding the science of functional anatomy and the concept of functional training (empty)
when an athlete (other) a nonfunctional exercise such as a (other) extension she is using a muscle action and (other) system (other) that is never (other) when walking or running (empty)
the athlete is by (other) performing an open chain muscle action (empty)
open chain (other) the foot is not in contact with the ground or a (other) (other) (empty)
to exercise a muscle as it will be used you (other) to (other) the chain and allow the muscles to work as they would when the foot is on the ground (empty)
in regard to the lower extremity open chain or single joint can be (other) almost synonymous with nonfunctional (empty)
the functional training controversy (other) (empty)
(other) the (other) (other) (other) there has been a (other) shift toward (other) to make training more functional (empty)
coaches (other) from a very (other) based barbell (other) program to a program that places more (other) on (other) exercise and (other) more dumbbell and (other) work (empty)
gary gray's work was the (other) for this change (empty)
the shift originated from the physical therapy (other) but the concept of functional training has (other) been (other) by both strength and conditioning coaches and (other) (other) (empty)
it might be (other) to (other) strength training as a (other) with gray's (other) approach on one end and the (other) barbell powerlifting approach on the other (empty)
the reason behind the (other) growth and (other) (other) of functional training is simple it makes sense to coaches and athletes and is (other) from their (other) in the training room and on the court track or field (empty)
small (other) functional training might be the (other) growth (other) in the (other) world (empty)
however the initial growth (other) of functional training was not without controversy and (other) (empty)
this (other) from (other) based on lack of (other) and (other) (other) (empty)
so in some (other) functional training was synonymous with balance exercises and stability balls (empty)
this seemed like (other) sense and difficult to (other) with (empty)
but many coaches viewed functional training as a move away from (other) lifting and (other) and a move toward athletes and (other) lifting (other) (other) on balance (other) and balls (empty)
(other) however some coaches who have (other) functional training espouse concepts that in the initial (other) appear nonfunctional (empty)
this use of apparently nonfunctional exercises by (other) (other) of functional training (other) some (other) in the field (empty)
exercises that promote the function of joints that require stabilization are different from exercises that promote the function of joints that (other) for (other) (empty)
the primary function of certain muscles and muscle groups is stabilization (empty)
functional training for those muscles (other) training them to be better stabilizers often by performing simple exercises through small (other) of (other) (empty)
in many (other) in the (other) to make (other) functional coaches and athletes (other) up (other) the important (other) (other) of certain muscle groups (empty)
for some athletes the development of stability at the hip may (other) require (other) hip work to (other) (other) on or (other) the muscles (empty)
for this reason some apparently nonfunctional single joint exercises may in fact improve function of the (other) lower extremity (empty)
this is one of the (other) of functional training (empty)
function at the shoulder joint is (other) by improving the function of the scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff (empty)
although many athletes (other) exercises for the rotator cuff few exercise scapular stabilizers (empty)
but performing sports skills without (other) scapular stabilizers is like (other) to (other) a (other) from a (other) (empty)
at our training (other) most athletes have both (other) rotator cuff strength and (other) strength or (other) of the scapular stabilizers (empty)
improving (other) strength to aid in the stabilization of the lower (other) is far from a (other) concept but the specific (other) are (other) (other) (empty)
the key to developing a truly functional training program is not to go (other) far in (other) (other) (other) (empty)
the (other) of exercises should be done (other) and should be multijoint but at the (other) time (other) should be (other) to development of the key (other) groups in the (other) (other) and (other) shoulder (empty)
a (other) functional (other) (other) around (other) (other) done in a sport specific position (empty)
(other) of this style of functional training espouse (other) exercises i (other) (other) done with a dumbbell or weight (other) in a (other) (other) and using foot (other) that some strength and conditioning coaches would (other) less than (other) (empty)
at what (other) do you cross the (other) from (other) training into (other) training (empty)
our position on this is simple (empty)
the key from the (other) (other) is for the training to make sense (empty)
program (other) around actions that do not (other) in sport simply (other) not make sense (empty)
the key is to (other) programs that truly (other) athletes for their sports (empty)
the key to (other) functional program is this (other) what you (other) and keep it simple (empty)
