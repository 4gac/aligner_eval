rhythm and expression (empty)
rhythm is (other) to (other) (empty)
its significance is (other) at only by (other) experiencing it (empty)
expressive movement is (other) rhythmical not only because of structural (other) but because of the (other) on its form by thought and feeling both of which (other) into responsive rhythms (empty)
in (other) to (other) rhythm may be (other) as a process by which (other) (other) (other) in time are (other) off (other) and (other) (empty)
(other) it all (other) be (other) (empty)
rhythm is (other) a (other) (other) of (other) (empty)
from the rhythms of his own (other) action or from the rhythms of (other) and (other) and from rhythm of activity in his (other) a dancer may (other) his (other) (empty)
any one of our (other) may be (other) in the (other) of a rhythmic experience (empty)
just as we are able to (other) a rhythmical (other) through the (other) sense so we can (other) through the kinesthetic sense to be (other) of (other) sensations in (other) of their duration and degrees of stress and force (empty)
it is this sense that (other) us of the (other) of the body and its parts of the (other) of effort and speed necessary for (other) (empty)
consciousness of meaning in movement comes through knowledge of its (other) (other) degrees of force time (other) and speed (empty)
in experiencing these rhythmic phases we (other) a fundamental and (other) (other) (other) organic (other) intellectual and discriminating (empty)
it is through the medium of these fundamental responses and their resulting (other) of (other) that there structural factors (other) (other) and emotional responses (empty)
in such a process there is (other) a (other) creative manifestation of the feeling life (empty)
thus we see that by rhythm much more is (other) than just (other) time (empty)
in its (other) meaning rhythm may be said to be the (other) through which expressive life (other) in (other) its forms (empty)
in dance movements are the motor (other) of action (other) the mental life of the dancer (empty)
through action dance (other) (other) (other) by the sensations of movement (empty)
the (other) phases of rhythmic movement may in (other) be said to be duration or the (other) (other) of time (other) by any (other) movement stress or the (other) of force or (other) with which (other) is (other) and (other) or the (other) at which movements (other) one (other) (empty)
out of such (other) a (other) and (other) (other) of responsive movements comes (other) into play and the form of movement (other) in artistic intellectual (other) will be (other) of the (other) which (other) it (empty)
(other) (other) (empty)
to develop a motor technique and a (other) discriminating kinesthetic sense to control it is one of the (other) to the (other) of dance (other) (empty)
it is a process of discovery analyses and (other) and a (other) according to an intellectual (other) which demands the best efforts of both mind and body (empty)
the mental effort (other) to (other) (other) demands so much (other) that other factors such as expression are bound to (other) (empty)
(other) activity becomes (other) and is (other) (other) with (other) or no thought thus (other) the mind for the (other) of artistic (other) (empty)
the (other) of a (other) (other) in a general (other) of the (other) (other) and out of this (other) activity there (other) the (other) (other) we (other) (other) (empty)
in this (other) all motor technique are the same (empty)
physical skill has the same general conditions (other) it is concerned with (other) (other) dance the (other) of an instrument or the (other) of (other) (empty)
technique of the physical instrument is motor (other) (empty)
it (other) a (other) and makes an artist of the (other) (empty)
when the mind is so (other) the force of its (other) (other) to (other) itself (other) some motor (other) and becomes (other) in movements of dance (empty)
here the will ceases to (other) and (other) (other) with the activity of the other mental (other) concerned in expression (empty)
the true (other) to expression is (other) than the will (empty)
(other) the (other) (other) the will and (other) the (other) to will or to (other) expressive results are in danger of being (other) and (other) (empty)
power of expression depends upon power of thought and feeling (empty)
(other) is (other) so (other) as the (other) to be expressive and to (other) emotional (empty)
every movement (other) organic (other) because of its origin (empty)
in working toward a (other) technique we (other) (other) (other) (other) movement into forms that (other) toward a (other) (empty)
the (other) more (other) form becomes (other) by the ideal form (empty)
this (other) of effort or technique when working from the (other) toward the ideal (other) the body to (other) on an (other) (other) (other) resulting in an (other) (other) (other) (other) (empty)
knowledge and expression (empty)
everyone (other) to such a study some general but (other) understanding with which to (other) (empty)
but with a (other) and (other) of (other) and (other) principles he can (other) a (other) study of movement (empty)
there must be an understanding of the fundamental science of movement (other) the skill for its control can develop (empty)
no artist can (other) to (other) (other) (other) between him and the (other) which (other) his work (empty)
the (other) of science is the discovery of the truth of (other) conditions (empty)
this discovery (other) the knowledge and (other) with which any artist or (other) artist may work (empty)
there need be no (other) between science and art (empty)
science will not (other) art — but it will contribute to a (other) art (empty)
it is of the greatest (other) when we are working toward art expression to know the conditions (other) which the mind (other) and the nature of the medium through which it works (empty)
our (other) are so (other) to be (other) and (other) (empty)
we must to be true to experience be (other) with understanding (empty)
through analyses of conditions that contribute to expression comes the necessary understanding by which we (other) (other) consciousness of our (other) as well as a (other) (other) of the efforts of (other) (empty)
but (other) much analyses may (other) the real significance of (other) — something may (other) so that in the (other) there is (other) of (other) than in the (other) (empty)
there is no danger in this process if we (other) (other) that the real (other) (other) in the whole — which is something more than the (other) of its parts (empty)
(other) (other) its (other) when (other) (other) (other) into one (other) (empty)
every form of (other) should be so (other) and (other) by the (other) that the artistic expression which has (other) out of that knowledge (other) to be the inevitable (other) of (other) (other) (empty)
such is the (other) of the very greatest works the works of (other) art (empty)
in the (other) (other) depends upon the individual (empty)
the (other) can (other) (other) for can (other) (other) but when it comes to the (other) itself the results will (other) upon the (other) (other) in control and artistic (other) and his potentialities as an artist (empty)
it is best as well as inevitable that such should be the (other) for when the body moves according its structural principles it moves (other) all other (other) and (other) the same forms (empty)
but when movement is (other) to the (other) of an individual (other) and (other) it ceases to be (other) (other) and becomes a manifestation of a (other) and individual being (empty)
everyone (other) (other) the same fundamental and (other) nature (empty)
(other) activity very (other) (other) the same results as (other) creative activity (empty)
it is only as he is able through his own effort to (other) to (other) and to (other) (other) he has (other) that he is (other) (other) (empty)
to (other) (other) and (other) expression the creative mind (other) to be (other) to (other) and (other) its (other) with a (other) (other) and (other) (empty)
to (other) the origin and nature of dance to (other) the (other) of its (other) (other) instrument and to be (other) of its potentialities for emotional (other) and (other) direction is to know the fundamental truth and (other) (other) of dance (empty)
you lost (other) he asks (other) a (other) or so has (other) (empty)
i shake my head (empty)
no boy (empty)

no one can (other) lost on an island of this (other) (empty)

best of all is new york (empty)
(other) (other) to new york (other) asks one of the other boys in a (other) (other) of a (other) that (other) up out of the (other) and which knows all there is to know (other) the (other) even at such a (other) age (empty)
