Because sequencing the genome revealed four very unexpected genes — genes for coding enzymes presumed to be uniquely cellular and never before seen in a virus.

The logical inference is that Mimivirus has them as holdovers because its lineage originated by genomic reduction from a cell.

According to the report's authors, Roberto Vetrugno and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, the disease had damaged the pair's brains to such an extent that they had entered status dissociatus, a kind of twilight zone in which the boundaries between sleep wakefulness completely break down. That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states. There is now overwhelming evidence that the primary states of being are not mutually exclusive, he says.

If he is right, we will have to rethink our understanding of what sleep is and what it is for. Maybe wakefulness is not the all-or-nothing phenomenon we thought it was either.

Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep.

It is as if they are socially awake but functionally asleep, as if the brain circuits underlying responsiveness are up and and running, but those mediating working memory are still offline.

One is REM behavioural disorder (RBD), in which people in REM sleep act out their dreams because the temporary paralsis, or cataplexy, that normally accompanies this state is replaced by the full mobility of wakefulness.

Two seconds is all it takes to be completely out of your lane. Up to 20 percent of traffic accidents are fatigue-related. Brain imaging has recently revealed a mental back-up system in people who remain alert when sleep-deprived (Journal of Neuroscience, vol 29, p 7948). While other people have reducted brain activity when tired, sleep-resistant individuals manage to maintain their brain activity levels. More interestingly, they also recruit new areas to help compensate for having been awake for so long. These people were selected for the study because they had a gene variant found in around 40 percent of people that is thought to be associated with resistance to sleep deprivation.
Another group who appear to be more vigilant than most are people who suffer from primary insomnia – insomnia not associated with any other condition.
Another group who appear to be more vigilant than most are people who suffer from primary insomnia – insomnia not associated with any other condition. There is evidence to suggest they are in a constant state of hyperarousal, with relatively high metabolic rates and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

There is evidence to suggest they are in a constant state of hyperarousal, with relatively high metabolic rates and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It's as though somebody just cranked up their alertness over 24 hours, so they are more alert at night, but they are also more alert in the day, says Mahowald.

Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps.
Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps. Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off.

All of that makes them fascinating but also mysterious. For a while she called them NLF: new life - form.

Meanwhile, Pierre Maquet at the University of Liège, in Belgium has started to use fMRI to chart the patterns of brain activity associated with different sleep states. His team is already finding that the distinctions between sleep and wakefulness look quite different when you compare patterns of activity across the whole brain, including deep structures, as opposed to using EEG, which measures activity in just the outer few millimetres of the cortex.

As far back as 150 million years ago, viruses infected mammals and left genes that led to a dramatic evolutionary advance: the placenta, which allows nutrients and oxygen to reach the fetus and waste and carbon dioxide to pass out.

Both had been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder called multiple system atrophy. According to the report's authors, Roberto Vetrugno and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, the disease had damaged the pair's brains to such an extent that they had entered status dissociatus, a kind of twilight zone in which the boundaries between sleep wakefulness completely break down.

Brain imaging has recently revealed a mental back-up system in people who remain alert when sleep-deprived (Journal of Neuroscience, vol 29, p 7948). While other people have reducted brain activity when tired, sleep-resistant individuals manage to maintain their brain activity levels. More interestingly, they also recruit new areas to help compensate for having been awake for so long.
But as soon as we provoke the system with some sleep deprivation, those differences get larger and larger, he says (Journal of Sleep Research, vol16, p 170). This has implications for all of us, especially those in professions where staying awake is a life-or-death matter (see ground control to Major Tom).

These people were selected for the study because they had a gene variant found in around 40 percent of people that is thought to be associated with resistance to sleep deprivation.

It seems likely that such people are also less prone to state dissociation, although this has not yet been tested.

Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps.

But if the host cell is lucky, maybe the virus simply settles into this cozy outpost — either going dormant or back-engineering its little genome into the host’s genome — and bides its time.

Groping for competitive edge, some may have found or created protection within membranes and walls, leading to the first cells. These cells gave rise to offspring by fission, splitting in two. They split in a broader sense too, diverging to become Bacteria and Archaea, two of the three domains of cellular life. The third, Eukarya, arose sometime later.

Dinges sees them as the outward sign of a tug-of-war between neural systems that are trying to initiate sleep, and others that are trying to maintain wakefulness. This chimes with the ideas of James Krueger of Washington State University in Pullman, who has argued that the individual processing units in the brain – known as cortical columns – fall asleep independently when they become tired.

Dinges sees them as the outward sign of a tug-of-war between neural systems that are trying to initiate sleep, and others that are trying to maintain wakefulness. This chimes with the ideas of James Krueger of Washington State University in Pullman, who has argued that the individual processing units in the brain – known as cortical columns – fall asleep independently when they become tired.

In a 2007 study, Dinges and his colleagues showed that there are enormous differences in people's ability to resist the lure of sleep when tired.

If you're doing 100 kilometers per hour on a highway and you have a lapse, your fingers go lax on the steering wheel and you drift off the road at a 4 – degree angle, says Dinges.
Discovery of the giant viruses inspired other scientists, notably Patrick Forterre at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, to formulate novel ideas about what viruses are and what constructive roles they have played, and continue to play, in the evolution and functions of cellular life.

That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states.
Earlier this year, a puzzling report appeared in the journal Sleep Medicine. It described two Italian people who never truly slept. They might lie down and close their eyes, but read-outs of brain activity showed none of the normal patterns associated with sleep. Their behaviour was pretty odd, too. Though largely unaware of their surroundings during these rest periods, they would walk around, yell, tremble violently and their hearts would race.

Lurking in the background is the hope that these approaches will shed light on the vexed issue of what sleep is for. A leading theory is that it is important for memory consolitadion.
Forgetfulness and daydreaming could be examples of this, but so could more bizzare and even criminal behaviours (See When a crime is not a crime, page 32).

One is REM behavioural disorder (RBD), in which people in REM sleep act out their dreams because the temporary paralsis, or cataplexy, that normally accompanies this state is replaced by the full mobility of wakefulness. In sleep paralysis the opposite is true. Here, cataplexy intrudes into wakefulness, and a person wakes to find him or herself unable to move. It is estimated that up to 40 percent of people have experienced this disturbing phenomenon. Also suprisingly common are hypnagogic hallucinations – sensory illusions that occur on the cusp of sleep when the dreaming component of REM intrudes into wkefulness. Mahowald's list also includes sleepwalking, night terrors and narcolepsy, which is an inherent instability in vigilance state boundaries characterised by rapid cycling between states and the tendency to fall asleep mid-sentence. Controversially, the list also includes near-death experiences and alien abductions. It is no coincidence, he says, that alien abductions almost always occur in the recumbent position, in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Sleep is a highly complex phenomenon in which changes in sensory, muscular, hormonal and neural systems must be coordinated to create a particular state of vigilance.

His team is already finding that the distinctions between sleep and wakefulness look quite different when you compare patterns of activity across the whole brain, including deep structures, as opposed to using EEG, which measures activity in just the outer few millimetres of the cortex.

A virus can copy itself only by entering a cell and commandeering the 3D-printing machinery that turns genetic information into proteins. A Neanderthal skull, one of the most complete yet found, rests near human skeletons in the Musée de l’Homme in Paris. When modern humans left Africa, they interbred with Neanderthals and instantly acquired genes that had evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists have found 152 genes inherited from Neanderthals that help create an immune response.

Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep.

Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep. Each state is distinct and can be recognised by characteristic pattern of brain activity, as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG).

If the host cell is unlucky, many new viral particles are manufactured, they come busting out, and the cell is left as wreckage.
If the host cell is unlucky, many new viral particles are manufactured, they come busting out, and the cell is left as wreckage. That sort of damage — such as what SARS-CoV-2 causes in the epithelial cells of the human airway — is partly how a virus becomes a pathogen.

So, the question was, Claverie said, what the hell has a virus the need for those fancy enzymes, normally active in cells, when he has the cell at his disposal, OK?

Its genome was also huge for a virus, almost 1.2 million letters long, compared to, say, 13, 000 for an influenza virus, or even 194, 000 for smallpox. (DNA, like RNA, is a long molecule built with four different molecular bases, which scientists abbreviate by their first letters.) It was an impossible virus: viral in nature but too big in scale, like a newly discovered Amazon butterfly with a four-foot wingspan.
Inside some of them was this mysterious blob. It was big enough to be seen through a light microscope (viruses supposedly were too small for that, visible only by electron microscope), and it looked like a bacterium. Scientists tried to detect bacterial genes within it but found none.

It is no coincidence, he says, that alien abductions almost always occur in the recumbent position, in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Sleep is a highly complex phenomenon in which changes in sensory, muscular, hormonal and neural systems must be coordinated to create a particular state of vigilance. When you think about it, there are billions of pepole in the world who are shifting between wakefulness, REM and non-REM multiple times every 24 hours, says Mahowald. It's amazing that the switching is as accurate as it is. This accuracy suggests that there is a strong adaptive drive to be fully in one state or another. But he also thinks that state dissociation – the presence of more than one vigilance state concurrently – is more common than anyone previously suspected. The boundaries between sleep and wakefulness are particularly blurred when we are sleep-deprived.

Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off.

It seems likely that such people are also less prone to state dissociation, although this has not yet been tested.
It seems likely that such people are also less prone to state dissociation, although this has not yet been tested. Another group who appear to be more vigilant than most are people who suffer from primary insomnia – insomnia not associated with any other condition.

Another group who appear to be more vigilant than most are people who suffer from primary insomnia – insomnia not associated with any other condition. There is evidence to suggest they are in a constant state of hyperarousal, with relatively high metabolic rates and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

It's amazing that the switching is as accurate as it is. This accuracy suggests that there is a strong adaptive drive to be fully in one state or another. But he also thinks that state dissociation – the presence of more than one vigilance state concurrently – is more common than anyone previously suspected. The boundaries between sleep and wakefulness are particularly blurred when we are sleep-deprived. Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps. Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off. Dinges sees them as the outward sign of a tug-of-war between neural systems that are trying to initiate sleep, and others that are trying to maintain wakefulness. This chimes with the ideas of James Krueger of Washington State University in Pullman, who has argued that the individual processing units in the brain – known as cortical columns – fall asleep independently when they become tired. In his view, shifts between wakefulness and sleep occur when enough columns are in one state or the other (Nature Reviews Neuroscience, vol 9, p 910). Krueger believes this mosaic pattern of sleep explains sleep inertia and sleepwaling.
It's as though somebody just cranked up their alertness over 24 hours, so they are more alert at night, but they are also more alert in the day, says Mahowald.
It's as though somebody just cranked up their alertness over 24 hours, so they are more alert at night, but they are also more alert in the day, says Mahowald. As the blur between sleep and wakefulness becomes more widely accepted, researchers are devising techniques for capturing the brain's fleeting lapses and vacillations.

For example, neuroscientist Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is eavesdropping on sleeping brains using EEGs with 256 electrodes rather than the more usual 32, to improve spatial resolution and help him catch the brain in the act of mosaic napping.

It is estimated that up to 40 percent of people have experienced this disturbing phenomenon. Also suprisingly common are hypnagogic hallucinations – sensory illusions that occur on the cusp of sleep when the dreaming component of REM intrudes into wkefulness.
Known as sleep inertia, a less extreme version of such disorientation is now generally recognised as the cause of the grogginess some people get after their alarm clock goes off. It is as if they are socially awake but functionally asleep, as if the brain circuits underlying responsiveness are up and and running, but those mediating working memory are still offline. Mahowald is convinced that it is just one of many disorders that can be explained as a breakdown in the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness. He lits a whole raft of such conditions in the same issue of Sleep Medicine as Vetrugnos description of people with status dissociatus (vol. 10, p. 159).

Mahowald's list also includes sleepwalking, night terrors and narcolepsy, which is an inherent instability in vigilance state boundaries characterised by rapid cycling between states and the tendency to fall asleep mid-sentence.

If you're doing 100 kilometers per hour on a highway and you have a lapse, your fingers go lax on the steering wheel and you drift off the road at a 4 – degree angle, says Dinges.

When we woke them up abruptly, and they rated themselves as alert and ready to go, they couln't do even one subtraction, says Dinges. People even seemed to be dreaming as they attempted the task. One subject mused: What if people ran faster than normal people run home, in the middle of a string of incorrect responses. Known as sleep inertia, a less extreme version of such disorientation is now generally recognised as the cause of the grogginess some people get after their alarm clock goes off.
Mahowald's list also includes sleepwalking, night terrors and narcolepsy, which is an inherent instability in vigilance state boundaries characterised by rapid cycling between states and the tendency to fall asleep mid-sentence.

Controversially, the list also includes near-death experiences and alien abductions. It is no coincidence, he says, that alien abductions almost always occur in the recumbent position, in the transition from wakefulness to sleep.

Sleep is a highly complex phenomenon in which changes in sensory, muscular, hormonal and neural systems must be coordinated to create a particular state of vigilance.

When you think about it, there are billions of pepole in the world who are shifting between wakefulness, REM and non-REM multiple times every 24 hours, says Mahowald.

Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps.

Meanwhile, Pierre Maquet at the University of Liège, in Belgium has started to use fMRI to chart the patterns of brain activity associated with different sleep states.

His team is already finding that the distinctions between sleep and wakefulness look quite different when you compare patterns of activity across the whole brain, including deep structures, as opposed to using EEG, which measures activity in just the outer few millimetres of the cortex. Lurking in the background is the hope that these approaches will shed light on the vexed issue of what sleep is for.

Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia. Up to twice as big as a Mimivirus, even more anomalous, these were assigned to a separate genus, which Claverie and his colleagues named Pandoravirus, evoking Pandora’s box, as they explained in 2013, because of the surprises expected from their further study.

Most of the time you are either awake or asleep, yet these are far from the only statues our minds can enter. Over the next 10 pages we explore some of these journeys of the mind, from hypnosis to sleep paralysis.

One is REM behavioural disorder (RBD), in which people in REM sleep act out their dreams because the temporary paralsis, or cataplexy, that normally accompanies this state is replaced by the full mobility of wakefulness. In sleep paralysis the opposite is true. Here, cataplexy intrudes into wakefulness, and a person wakes to find him or herself unable to move.

Also suprisingly common are hypnagogic hallucinations – sensory illusions that occur on the cusp of sleep when the dreaming component of REM intrudes into wkefulness. Mahowald's list also includes sleepwalking, night terrors and narcolepsy, which is an inherent instability in vigilance state boundaries characterised by rapid cycling between states and the tendency to fall asleep mid-sentence.

It is no coincidence, he says, that alien abductions almost always occur in the recumbent position, in the transition from wakefulness to sleep.

When you think about it, there are billions of pepole in the world who are shifting between wakefulness, REM and non-REM multiple times every 24 hours, says Mahowald.

These opportunistic elements achieve their Darwinian success simply by bouncing from one part of a genome to another, in rare cases from one cell to another, even one species to another, using cellular resources to get themselves copied, over and over.

Known as sleep inertia, a less extreme version of such disorientation is now generally recognised as the cause of the grogginess some people get after their alarm clock goes off. It is as if they are socially awake but functionally asleep, as if the brain circuits underlying responsiveness are up and and running, but those mediating working memory are still offline. Mahowald is convinced that it is just one of many disorders that can be explained as a breakdown in the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness. He lits a whole raft of such conditions in the same issue of Sleep Medicine as Vetrugnos description of people with status dissociatus (vol. 10, p. 159). One is REM behavioural disorder (RBD), in which people in REM sleep act out their dreams because the temporary paralsis, or cataplexy, that normally accompanies this state is replaced by the full mobility of wakefulness. In sleep paralysis the opposite is true. Here, cataplexy intrudes into wakefulness, and a person wakes to find him or herself unable to move.

Previous definitions of virus were inadequate, Forterre proposed, because scientists were confusing viral particles — the capsid - enclosed bits of genome, properly known as virions — with the totality of a virus.

Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep.

Its genome was also huge for a virus, almost 1.2 million letters long, compared to, say, 13, 000 for an influenza virus, or even 194, 000 for smallpox. (DNA, like RNA, is a long molecule built with four different molecular bases, which scientists abbreviate by their first letters.) It was an impossible virus: viral in nature but too big in scale, like a newly discovered Amazon butterfly with a four-foot wingspan. Jean-Michel Claverie was a senior member of that Marseille team. The discovery of Mimivirus, Claverie told me, Caused a lot of trouble. Why? Because sequencing the genome revealed four very unexpected genes — genes for coding enzymes presumed to be uniquely cellular and never before seen in a virus.

It was big enough to be seen through a light microscope (viruses supposedly were too small for that, visible only by electron microscope), and it looked like a bacterium.

Similar giant viruses were soon detected in the Sargasso Sea, and the early name became a genus, Mimivirus, containing several giants.
Similar giant viruses were soon detected in the Sargasso Sea, and the early name became a genus, Mimivirus, containing several giants. Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia.

Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia. Up to twice as big as a Mimivirus, even more anomalous, these were assigned to a separate genus, which Claverie and his colleagues named Pandoravirus, evoking Pandora’s box, as they explained in 2013, because of the surprises expected from their further study.

Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off.
Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off. Dinges sees them as the outward sign of a tug-of-war between neural systems that are trying to initiate sleep, and others that are trying to maintain wakefulness.

But today some viruses are known to do good. What’s wrapped up in the protein is a genetic dispatch, and that might turn out to be good news or bad, depending. Where did the first viruses come from? This requires us to squint back almost four billion years, to the time when life on Earth was just emerging from an inchoate cookery of long molecules, simpler organic compounds, and energy.

Each viral particle consists of a stretch of genetic instructions (written either in DNA or that other information - bearing molecule, RNA) packaged inside a protein capsule (known as a capsid). The capsid, in some cases, is surrounded by a membranous envelope (like the caramel on a caramel apple), which protects it and helps it catch hold of a cell. A virus can copy itself only by entering a cell and commandeering the 3D-printing machinery that turns genetic information into proteins. A Neanderthal skull, one of the most complete yet found, rests near human skeletons in the Musée de l’Homme in Paris.
That sort of damage — such as what SARS-CoV-2 causes in the epithelial cells of the human airway — is partly how a virus becomes a pathogen.
That sort of damage — such as what SARS-CoV-2 causes in the epithelial cells of the human airway — is partly how a virus becomes a pathogen. But if the host cell is lucky, maybe the virus simply settles into this cozy outpost — either going dormant or back-engineering its little genome into the host’s genome — and bides its time.

This second possibility carries many implications for the mixing of genomes, for evolution, even for our sense of identity as humans, a topic to which I’ll return.

One hint, for now: In a popular 1983 book the British biologist Peter Medawar and his wife, Jean, an editor, asserted, No virus is known to do good: It has been well said that a virus is ‘a piece of bad news wrapped up in protein.’

That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states.

The boundaries between sleep and wakefulness are particularly blurred when we are sleep-deprived.
The boundaries between sleep and wakefulness are particularly blurred when we are sleep-deprived. Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps.

Around a decate ago, Dinges realised that althought his sleep- deprived volunteers seemed to be awake, they were in fact experiencing momentary lapses, or microsleeps. Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off.

So, the question was, Claverie said, what the hell has a virus the need for those fancy enzymes, normally active in cells, when he has the cell at his disposal, OK?

Finally a team of researchers in Marseille, France, invited the thing to infect other amoebas, sequenced its genome, recognized what it was, and named it Mimivirus, because it mimicked bacteria, at least with regard to size.

The escape hypothesis posits that genes or stretches of genomes leaked out of cells, became encased within protein capsids, and went rogue, finding a new niche as parasites.
The escape hypothesis posits that genes or stretches of genomes leaked out of cells, became encased within protein capsids, and went rogue, finding a new niche as parasites. The reduction hypothesis suggests that viruses originated when some cells downsized under competitive pressure (it being easier to replicate if you’re small and simple), shedding genes until they were reduced to such minimalism that only by parasitizing cells could they survive.

Claverie’s senior co-author on that paper was Chantal Abergel, a virologist and structural biologist (and also his wife).
The real wholeness of the virus also includes its presence within a cell, once it has seized the cell’s machinery to replicate more virions, more seeds of itself.

The reduction hypothesis suggests that viruses originated when some cells downsized under competitive pressure (it being easier to replicate if you’re small and simple), shedding genes until they were reduced to such minimalism that only by parasitizing cells could they survive.

That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states. There is now overwhelming evidence that the primary states of being are not mutually exclusive, he says. The blurring of sleep and wakefulness is very clear in status dissociatus, but he believes it can happen to us all.

Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia.
Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia. Up to twice as big as a Mimivirus, even more anomalous, these were assigned to a separate genus, which Claverie and his colleagues named Pandoravirus, evoking Pandora’s box, as they explained in 2013, because of the surprises expected from their further study.

As far back as 150 million years ago, viruses infected mammals and left genes that led to a dramatic evolutionary advance: the placenta, which allows nutrients and oxygen to reach the fetus and waste and carbon dioxide to pass out.

There are three leading hypotheses to explain the evolutionary origins of viruses, known to scientists as viruses - first, escape, and reduction. Viruses - first is the notion that viruses came into existence before cells, somehow assembling themselves directly from that primeval cookery.

If he is right, we will have to rethink our understanding of what sleep is and what it is for. Maybe wakefulness is not the all-or-nothing phenomenon we thought it was either. Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep.

According to the report's authors, Roberto Vetrugno and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, the disease had damaged the pair's brains to such an extent that they had entered status dissociatus, a kind of twilight zone in which the boundaries between sleep wakefulness completely break down. That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states.

Consciousness is a strange beast. Most of the time you are either awake or asleep, yet these are far from the only statues our minds can enter. Over the next 10 pages we explore some of these journeys of the mind, from hypnosis to sleep paralysis. Some of them may seem scary and exotic, but most of us experience at least one at some point in our lives. All reveal the malleability of the human mind and the fragility of that sense of me, here, now. Enjoy the trip.

Up to twice as big as a Mimivirus, even more anomalous, these were assigned to a separate genus, which Claverie and his colleagues named Pandoravirus, evoking Pandora’s box, as they explained in 2013, because of the surprises expected from their further study. As far back as 150 million years ago, viruses infected mammals and left genes that led to a dramatic evolutionary advance: the placenta, which allows nutrients and oxygen to reach the fetus and waste and carbon dioxide to pass out.
Those enzymes, Claverie explained, are among the components that translate the genetic code to assemble amino acids into proteins. So, the question was, Claverie said, what the hell has a virus the need for those fancy enzymes, normally active in cells, when he has the cell at his disposal, OK? What need indeed? The logical inference is that Mimivirus has them as holdovers because its lineage originated by genomic reduction from a cell. Mimivirus was no fluke.

Though largely unaware of their surroundings during these rest periods, they would walk around, yell, tremble violently and their hearts would race. The remainder of the time they were conscious and aware but prone to powerful, dream-like hallucinations. Both had been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder called multiple system atrophy.

According to the report's authors, Roberto Vetrugno and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, the disease had damaged the pair's brains to such an extent that they had entered status dissociatus, a kind of twilight zone in which the boundaries between sleep wakefulness completely break down.

That this can happen contradicts the way we usually think about sleep, but it came as no surprise to Mark Mahowald, medical director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, who has long contested the dogma that sleep and wakefulness are discrete and distinct states.

Received wisdom has it that at any given time, healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance: awake, in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or in non-REM (NREM) sleep.

Humans and other mammals with placentas can move around with their unborn young, making them less vulnerable to predators. In humans, two genes originating from viruses. This membrane also may aid in preventing the mother’s immune system from attacking the fetus as a foreign object. Claverie’s senior co-author on that paper was Chantal Abergel, a virologist and structural biologist (and also his wife). Of the Pandoraviruses, Abergel told me, with a weary laugh: They were highly challenging. They are my babies. She explained how difficult it had been to tell what they were, these creatures — so different from cells, so different from classical viruses, carrying many genes that resembled nothing ever before seen. All of that makes them fascinating but also mysterious.
Viruses - first is the notion that viruses came into existence before cells, somehow assembling themselves directly from that primeval cookery.
Viruses - first is the notion that viruses came into existence before cells, somehow assembling themselves directly from that primeval cookery. The escape hypothesis posits that genes or stretches of genomes leaked out of cells, became encased within protein capsids, and went rogue, finding a new niche as parasites.

The escape hypothesis posits that genes or stretches of genomes leaked out of cells, became encased within protein capsids, and went rogue, finding a new niche as parasites. The reduction hypothesis suggests that viruses originated when some cells downsized under competitive pressure (it being easier to replicate if you’re small and simple), shedding genes until they were reduced to such minimalism that only by parasitizing cells could they survive.

When we woke them up abruptly, and they rated themselves as alert and ready to go, they couln't do even one subtraction, says Dinges. People even seemed to be dreaming as they attempted the task.

It is as if they are socially awake but functionally asleep, as if the brain circuits underlying responsiveness are up and and running, but those mediating working memory are still offline.

Since then, he has discovered that these fleeting naps last between half a second and 2 secons, and become increasingly frequent the longer we are deprived of sleep, until finally we cannot recover and nod off.

Those enzymes, Claverie explained, are among the components that translate the genetic code to assemble amino acids into proteins. So, the question was, Claverie said, what the hell has a virus the need for those fancy enzymes, normally active in cells, when he has the cell at his disposal, OK? What need indeed? The logical inference is that Mimivirus has them as holdovers because its lineage originated by genomic reduction from a cell. Mimivirus was no fluke. Similar giant viruses were soon detected in the Sargasso Sea, and the early name became a genus, Mimivirus, containing several giants. Then the Marseille team discovered two more behemoths — again, both parasites of amoebas — one taken from shallow marine sediments off the coast of Chile, the other from a pond in Australia.

Up to twice as big as a Mimivirus, even more anomalous, these were assigned to a separate genus, which Claverie and his colleagues named Pandoravirus, evoking Pandora’s box, as they explained in 2013, because of the surprises expected from their further study.
Yet one of the puzzling aspects of the two Italians with status dissociatus is that, despite complete disruption of both their REM and NREM sleep, they showed no memory deficit.
Yet one of the puzzling aspects of the two Italians with status dissociatus is that, despite complete disruption of both their REM and NREM sleep, they showed no memory deficit. Does this add grist to the mill of those who beileve that sleep has no other purpose than to save energy and keep us safe (New Scientist, 15 March 2008, p 30)?

Or does it mean, as Mahowald believes, that the two individuals were in fact experiencing some sort of mosaic sleep?
You think you're awake, yet part of your brain is sleeping.

It described two Italian people who never truly slept. They might lie down and close their eyes, but read-outs of brain activity showed none of the normal patterns associated with sleep. Their behaviour was pretty odd, too. Though largely unaware of their surroundings during these rest periods, they would walk around, yell, tremble violently and their hearts would race.

According to the report's authors, Roberto Vetrugno and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, the disease had damaged the pair's brains to such an extent that they had entered status dissociatus, a kind of twilight zone in which the boundaries between sleep wakefulness completely break down.
