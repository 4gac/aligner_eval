viruses first is the notion that viruses came into existence before cells (other) (other) themselves (other) from that (other) (other) (empty)
the escape hypothesis (other) that genes or (other) of genomes (other) out of cells became (other) within protein capsids and (other) (other) finding a new (other) as parasites (empty)

there is also a fourth variant known as the (other) hypothesis which takes (other) from (other) her (other) of genetic elements (other) (other) called (other) genes (empty)

jean (other) claverie was a senior (other) of that marseille team (empty)
the discovery of mimivirus claverie told me (other) a lot of (other) (empty)
(other) (empty)

there is now (other) evidence that the primary states of being are not (other) (other) he says (empty)
the (other) of sleep and wakefulness is very (other) in status dissociatus but he believes it can happen to us all (empty)
if he is right we will have to (other) our (other) of what sleep is and what it is for (empty)
maybe wakefulness is not the all or nothing phenomenon we thought it was either (empty)
(other) (other) has it that at any (other) time healthy people are in one of three states of vigilance awake in rapid eye (other) rem sleep or in non rem nrem sleep (empty)
each state is distinct and can be recognised by (other) pattern of brain activity as (other) by an (other) eeg (empty)

(other) dinges a (other) at the university of (other) (other) has probably deprived more people of sleep in the name of (other) than anyone (other) (empty)
