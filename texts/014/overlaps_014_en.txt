She stared at the apartment and nodded at it, as if it had asked her the question. Well, did you want to come in for a little while? I can't stay long, I do have to go soon, but you can come in for a few minutes if you want.

Admitted to the hospital, and carrying no identification, she reluctantly told the authorities she was Anastasia Romanov and recounted a detailed story of how she had escaped the slaughter. She later moved to the United States, where she went by the name Anna Anderson and continued claiming she was Anastasia until her death in 1984. Although it is generally believed Anderson was a mentally ill Polish factory worker, her extraordinary story became the subject of public fascination, and the inspiration for the 1956 movie Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman as the lost grand duchess.

But I saw him. I saw the tip of one of his pink fingers poking out of a hole in his glove. His hands were up against his mouth which was covered in a thick dark beard and his breath came in a long slow billow of white smoke, like the mouth of a gutter under a frozen street.

At Ganina Yama—the first place where Bolsheviks tried to dispose of the bodies— the Russian Orthodox Church erected a monastery. Where the Ipatiev House once stood, the magnificent Church on the Blood was consecrated in 2003 and has since become a pilgrimage site. In 2007 Alexei’s and Maria’s remains were found, and later identified using DNA analysis. It has been said that families who are closely attached may cut themselves off from the outside world.
Finding their bones began a healing process in which both the horrors of their deaths and their places in history could be acknowledged.

I didn't own a tea kettle either. I didn't see why people spent money on things like that when they could function perfectly well without them.

There was no one waiting for me behind the shower curtain. Nothing was ever out of place. There were never any footprints circling my apartment, or scratch marks around my doorknob.

We were standing there in the middle of the frozen street, her car was still running and dripping fluid, making a little puddle that was curling and flowing over the cracks in the ice and the dirty solid snow that was pushed up onto the curb.

He sat with me while I overcooked my eggs and searched the internet for a cat to adopt, each time deciding against it because I could imagine it snowballing into two or three until I became one of those women. The outside world that day, and every day since I had been living there, was a white swirling mixture of ground and sky. Set against the bright seamless backdrop was the outline of a man.

It was the greatest mercy of their last months that, right up to the terrible end, they were, at the very least, all together. It was during the first snowstorm of the new year. The color green was something you saw in pictures tacked to the wall or in a memory from what felt like years ago. I was living alone in a studio apartment in a shitty section of west Cleveland. There were no stairs to get to my apartment. I was as far down as you can get without going under. I slept in the same room as the oven, but I liked the smallness of it. When I was young my sister and I used to zip each other into suitcases. We would drag the suitcases up and down the stairs, and all around the living room, laughing hysterically. That first morning I wrapped a scarf around my neck and lit the stove.

If someone told me that they saw a strange man staring at them through their window I would have expected to hear them say, And then I screamed and dropped my glass and it shattered and I ran to the phone and dialed 911andthen I ran to my front door and pulled the deadbolt acrossand then I hid in the bathroom with the doorclosedand I couldn't stop shaking.

Oh, yeah, thanks, she said softly. I watched her lean into her car and shut it off, pull the keys out and put them in the pocket of her coat. When she turned to face me again I smiled a sort of awkward, ok right this way, kind of smile, and turned to walk to the apartment.

The nine other bodies were burned, doused with acid, and buried in a separate grave not too far away. Rumors that some of the Romanovs had survived their execution arose almost immediately after their deaths. Because their bodies remained undiscovered for decades and Communist authorities were coy about the events at the Ipatiev House, these whispers grew into legends. All of the Romanov children were impersonated at one time or another, but Anastasia was at the center of the most notorious claims to the Romanov estate. Perhaps the most famous claimant was a woman rescued from a Berlin canal in 1920. Admitted to the hospital, and carrying no identification, she reluctantly told the authorities she was Anastasia Romanov and recounted a detailed story of how she had escaped the slaughter. She later moved to the United States, where she went by the name Anna Anderson and continued claiming she was Anastasia until her death in 1984. Although it is generally believed Anderson was a mentally ill Polish factory worker, her extraordinary story became the subject of public fascination, and the inspiration for the 1956 movie Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman as the lost grand duchess.

As a new revolution spread through Russia, scientists returned to Yekaterinburg in 1991 to reclaim history. They exhumed the remains of nine people, who were later scientifically identified as Nicholas, Alexandra, Olga, Tatiana, Anastasia, and their four servants. Finding their bones began a healing process in which both the horrors of their deaths and their places in history could be acknowledged. In 1998 these remains were laid to rest in St. Petersburg’s Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral, traditional burial place of the tsars. In 2000 the Russian Orthodox Church canonized Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children as passion-bearers. At Ganina Yama—the first place where Bolsheviks tried to dispose of the bodies— the Russian Orthodox Church erected a monastery.

I can't stay long, I do have to go soon, but you can come in for a few minutes if you want. I know when I moved from my first house I always wanted to go back and see what they did to my old room. See if they painted it a different color or anything. I didn't paint anything yet. Maybe I will in the summer.

She stared at the house, and then at me and then back at the house again, and without saying anything she unlocked her seat belt and got out of the car.

Sure, she said finally.

Rumors that some of the Romanovs had survived their execution arose almost immediately after their deaths. Because their bodies remained undiscovered for decades and Communist authorities were coy about the events at the Ipatiev House, these whispers grew into legends.

The next morning I saw the white grey billows of exhaust fumes pouring out of a piece of shit station wagon in front of my apartment. I saw the woman's eyes, and they were glossy and dull. I had seen her baby basset hound eyebrows before, on the man at my window. She just stared at the door as if she was waiting for someone to come out. It happened that way three times. Not all at once, but spread so far out across two weeks that I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't a déjà vu, and that yes, this had really happened before.

The tsarina died from a bullet to the head. As the room filled with gun smoke, discipline among the killers vanished. The grand duchesses seemed unharmed by the bullets, which had ricocheted off their bodies (it was later discovered that diamond jewelry sewn into their clothing had acted like armor during the initial assault).

One of the murderers—a drunkard named Ermakov—lost all control and began to slash at the Romanovs with a bayonet.
